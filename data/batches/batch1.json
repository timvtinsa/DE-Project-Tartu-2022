However, there are surprisingly few direct measurements of the local\nmetallicities of different flavors of core-collapse SNe. Here we present the\nlargest existing set of host-galaxy spectra with H II region emission lines at\nthe sites of 35 stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe. We derive local oxygen\nabundances in a robust manner in order to constrain the SN Ib/c progenitor\npopulation. We obtain spectra at the SN sites, include SNe from targeted and\nuntargeted surveys, and perform the abundance determinatinos using three\ndifferent oxygen-abundance calibrations. The sites of SNe Ic (the demise of the\nmost heavily stripped stars having lost both the H and He layers) are\nsystematically more metal rich than those of SNe Ib (arising from stars that\nretained their He layer) in all calibrations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields\nthe very low probability of 1% that SN Ib and SN Ic environment abundances,\nwhich are different on average by ~0.2 dex (in the Pettini & Pagel scale), are\ndrawn from the same parent population. Broad-lined SNe Ic (without GRBs) occur\nat metallicities between those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic. Lastly, we find that the\nhost-galaxy central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local SN\nmetallicity; hence, large-scale SN surveys need to obtain local abundance\nmeasurements in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on stellar death.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 11:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 20:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-29","authors_parsed":[["Modjaz","Maryam",""],["Kewley","L.",""],["Bloom","J.

In this paper,\nwe investigate possible contribution to the Nv emission via resonant scattering\nof both continuum and Ly alpha in a broad absorption line (BAL) outflow, by\nperforming the Sobolev Monte Carlo simulations. The contribution is dependent\non the covering factor, optical depth and velocity profile of the outflow, as\nwell as the equivalent width (EW) of Ly alpha. Adopting model parameters\nconstrained by observations, we find that the measured Nv EW in the spectra of\nnon-BAL quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) could have been enhanced by a factor of\n1.82~2.73 on average, while there is only moderate absorption of Ly alpha along\nthe BAL outflow direction. Our model can produce a relatively narrow scattering\nline profile. About 80% of the total scattered flux falls within the central\n+-4500km/s. We find that the resonant scattering can produce a prominent\npolarized emission line around Nv. Both the broad excess emission and the\nunusually large polarized flux observed around Nv in BAL QSOs are considered as\nstrong evidence for the scattering enhancement. Future spectropolarimetric\nobservations and spectroscopic monitoring of luminous QSOs may offer crucial\ntests for this interpretation, and provide useful information on the physical\nand geometrical properties of QSO outflows. We argue that the scattering offers\na promising and robust process for producing the peculiar behavior of Nv\nemission compared to the other processes proposed previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 13:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Wang","Huiyuan",""],["Wang","Tinggui",""],["Yuan","Weimin",""],["Wang","Junxian",""],["Dong","Xiaobo",""],["Zhou","Hongyan",""]]}

Although the time\nevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modelling\nstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the\nformation of the protostar. Observing young stellar objects during these\nelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady\naccretion. ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded\nHerbig Be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a FU Orionis star. The\nHerbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst\ndetected so far. We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying\nthe emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer of\naccretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars. Using the\nAMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performed\nspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas\nemitting across the Brackett gamma emission line, during and after the\noutburst. From the visibilities and differential phases, we derive\ncharacteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric\nmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. We find that the\nline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistent\nwith the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter. They are,\ninstead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk hole\ninside the dust sublimation radius. The disappearance of the Brackett gamma\nemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a\nperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the\nline of sight. Based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of the\noutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring in\nEX Ors and FU Ors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 13:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Benisty","M.",""],["Malbet","F.",""],["Dougados","C.",""],["Natta","A.",""],["Bouquin","J.

A large velocity gradient (LVG) analysis finds that the giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) are similar to Galactic GMCs when studied at 180pc\n(120pc) resolution with an average kinetic temperature of T_kin = 20(16)K and\nH_2 density of n(H_2) = 120(240)cm^(-3) when assuming virialized clouds (a\nconstant velocity gradient dv/dr. The associated conversion factor between H_2\nmass and CO luminosity is close to the Galactic value for most regions\nanalyzed. Our findings suggest that the GMC population in the spiral arms of\nM51 is similar to those of the Milky Way and therefore the strong star\nformation occurring in the spiral arms has no strong impact on the molecular\ngas in the spiral arms. Extinction inferred from the derived H_2 column density\nis very high (A_V about 15 - 30 mag), about a factor of 5-10 higher than the\naverage value derived toward HII regions. Thus a significant fraction of the\nongoing star formation could be hidden inside the dust lanes of the spiral\narms. A comparison of MIPS 24um and H_alpha data, however, suggests that this\nis not the case and most of the GMCs studied here are not (yet) forming stars.\nWe also present low (4.5\") resolution OVRO maps of the HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0)\nemission at the location of the brightest 12CO(1-0) peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 14:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Schinnerer","E.","","MPIA"],["Weiss","A.","","MPIfR"],["Aalto","S.","","OSO"],["Scoville","N.

Moreover, the collision rules couple both velocities,\ninvolving not only the coefficient of normal restitution but also the\ncoefficient of tangential restitution. The aim of this paper is to propose an\nextension to inelastic rough particles of a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-like kinetic\nmodel previously proposed for inelastic smooth particles. The Boltzmann\ncollision operator is replaced by the sum of three terms representing: (i) the\nrelaxation to a two-temperature local equilibrium distribution, (ii) the action\nof a nonconservative drag force proportional to the peculiar velocity, and\n(iii) the action of a nonconservative torque equal to a linear combination of\nthe angular velocity and its mean value. The three coefficients in the force\nand torque are fixed to reproduce the Boltzmann collisional rates of change of\nthe mean angular velocity and of the two granular temperatures (translational\nand rotational). A simpler version of the model is also constructed in the form\nof two coupled kinetic equations for the translational and rotational velocity\ndistributions. The kinetic model is applied to the simple shear flow steady\nstate and the combined influence of the two coefficients of restitution on the\nshear and normal stresses and on the translational velocity distribution\nfunction is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2011 16:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10","authors_parsed":[["Santos","Andr\u00e9s",""]]}

M~33,\na local group spiral with a mass $\\sim 10$\\% and a metallicity half that of the\nGalaxy, represents a first step towards the metal poor Dwarf Galaxies.

If the electrons are spin-polarized, scattering at\nthe interface of a noble metal and a ferromagnet results in spin-transfer\ntorque and hence modifies the direction of M.

To this end, we must identify and\nexploit observables sensitive to weak magnetic fields (B<100 G) and to the\npresence of cool and hot gas in the bulk of the solar chromosphere. Here we\nreport on an investigation of the Hanle effect in two semi-empirical models of\nthe quiet solar atmosphere with different chromospheric thermal structures. Our\nstudy reveals that scattering polarization in the Ca II IR triplet has thermal\nand magnetic sensitivities potentially of great diagnostic value. The linear\npolarization in the 8498 A line shows a strong sensitivity to inclined magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 10 G, while the emergent linear\npolarization in the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is mainly sensitive to magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 0.1 G. The reason for this is that the\nscattering polarization of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines, unlike the 8498 A line,\nis controlled mainly by the Hanle effect in their (metastable) lower levels.\nTherefore, in regions with magnetic strengths sensibly larger than 1 G, their\nStokes Q and U profiles are sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic\nfield vector. We also find that for given magnetic field configurations the\nsign of the Q/I and U/I profiles of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is the same in\nboth atmospheric models, while the sign of the linear polarization profile of\nthe 8498 A line turns out to be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the\nlower chromosphere. We suggest that spectropolarimetric observations providing\ninformation on the relative scattering polarization amplitudes of the Ca II IR\ntriplet will be very useful to improve our empirical understanding of the\nthermal and magnetic structure of the quiet chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 17:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Sainz","R.

Penetration of hard wood is dominated by the vessel network which\nprohibits porous medium approximations. Our model considers two scales: a one\ndimensional capillary fluid transport of a hardening adhesive through a single,\nstraight vessel with diffusion of solvent through its walls and a mesoscopic\nscale based on topological characteristics of the vessel network, where results\nfrom the single vessel scale are mapped onto a periodic network. Given an\ninitial amount of adhesive and applied bonding pressure, we calculate the\nportion of the filled structure. The model is applied to beech wood samples\njoined with three different types of adhesive (PUR, UF, PVAC) under various\ngrowth ring angles. We evaluate adhesive properties and bond line morphologies\ndescribed in part I of this work. The model contains one free parameter that\ncan be adjusted in order to fit the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 20:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-07","authors_parsed":[["Mendoza","M.",""],["Hass","P.",""],["Wittel","F.
