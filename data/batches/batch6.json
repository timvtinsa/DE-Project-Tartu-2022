The temperature and density structure of the gas is\nvaried in order to differentiate between (i) simultaneous gas infall at a large\nrange of radii and (ii) the inside-out build-up of a disk. In all cases, the\ndisks go through phases of ring formation, gravitational instability and\nbreak-up into massive clumps. Ring formation can be enhanced by a focal point\neffect. The position of the ring is determined by the angular momentum\ndistribution of the material it forms from. We study the ring and clump\nmorphologies, the characteristic properties of the resulting velocity\ndispersion field and the effect of star formation. In the early phases, gas\naccretion leads to a high vertical velocity dispersion. We find that the disk\nfragmentation by gravitational instability and the subsequent clump-clump\ninteractions drive high velocity dispersions mainly in the plane of the disk\nwhile at the same time the vertical velocity dispersion dissipates. The result\nis a strong variation of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion with inclination\nangle. For a face-on view, clumps appear as minima in the (vertical)\ndispersion, whereas for a more edge-on view, they tend to correspond to maxima.\nThere exists observational evidence of a systematic variation of the velocity\ndispersion with inclination angle in high-redshift disks, which could be partly\nexplained by our simulation results.

In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by\none or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by\ninverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,\nthe linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission\nmodels, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy\nintegral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes\nsignificantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to\napply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed\nelectrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve\nthe differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of\nthe electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear\ncooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the\nelectron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the\nlinear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate\nanalytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which\nwill be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <\n1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear\ncooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined\ncooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for\nthe large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small\nfrequencies, again. This is the same behaviour as for monoenergetically\ninjected electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17","authors_parsed":[["Zacharias","M.",""],["Schlickeiser","R.",""]]}

Customarily,\nP-wave arrival detection techniques use vertical component seismogram which is\nappropriate only for teleseismic events. The inherent weakness of those methods\nstems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal\nand vertical recording channels.

Methods: We\nacquired data of the program stars of high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and high\nresolution with the Asiago Echelle spectrograph. Radial velocities were\nobtained by applying cross-correlation and atmospheric parameters via chi2 fit\nto a synthetic spectral library. Extensive tests were carried out by\nre-observing with the same instrument a large number of standard stars taken\nfrom a variety of sources in the literature. During these tests, we found that\nthe absolute Tycho VT magnitude of local red clump stars is not dependent on\nmetallicity. Results: A total of 277 red clump stars (101 of them with a second\nepoch observation) of the extended solar neighborhood and 55 calibration stars\nwere observed and included in an output catalog that contains (in addition to\nrelevant support astrometric and photometric data taken from literature) the\nmain output of our survey: accurate multi-epoch radial velocities (sigma(RV)=<\n0.4 km/s), accurate atmospheric parameters (sigma(Teff)=68 K, sigma(log g)=0.11\ndex, sigma([M/H])=0.10 dex, sigma(Vrot sin i)=1.1 km/sec), distances, and space\nvelocities (U,V,W).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Valentini","M.",""],["Munari","U.",""]]}

SN Ic is a very unique boron source because it can produce boron\nthrough not only spallation reactions as discussed in Nakamura & Shigeyama\n(2004) but also the neutrino-process. The neutrino-process is considered to\noccur in core-collapse supernovae and previous studies were limited to Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II). Although the progenitor star of an SN Ic does not posses a\nHe envelope so that 7Li production via the neutrino-process is unlikely, 11B\ncan be produced in the C-rich layers. We demonstrate a hydrodynamic simulation\nof SN Ic explosion and estimate the amounts of the light elements produced via\nthe neutrino-process for the first time, and also the subsequent spallation\nreactions between the outermost layers of compact SN Ic progenitor and the\nambient medium. We find that the neutrino-process in the current SN Ic model\nproduces a significant amount of 11B, which is diluted by 10B from spallation\nreactions to get closer to B isotopic ratios observed in meteorites. We also\nconfirm that high-temperature mu- and tau-neutrinos and their anti-neutrinos,\nreasonably suggested from the compact structure of SN Ic progenitors, enhance\nthe light element production through the neutral-current reactions, which may\nimply an important role of SNe Ic in the Galactic chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Nakamura","Ko",""],["Yoshida","Takashi",""],["Shigeyama","Toshikazu",""],["Kajino","Toshitaka",""]]}

Based on the SED shape and the assumption that\nit was produced by a single star and its disk, CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a\nprototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by\na planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. However, recently\nit has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system. This implies\nthat the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. The\naim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the\ninner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is known\nabout the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between\nthese stars and their surrounding disk. In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED,\nthe binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-IR variability\n(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the\ncircumbinary disk. Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is\nlocated at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU). A\nsmall amount of optically thin dust in the hole (<0.01 lunar masses) helps to\nimprove the fit to the 10microns silicate band. Also, we find that water ice\nshould be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio\n<5.6X10^{-5}). In general, for a binary system with eccentricity e>0, the model\npredicts mid-IR variability with periods similar to orbital timescales,\nassuming that thermal equilibrium is reached instantaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 19:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Nagel","Erick",""],["D'Alessio","Paola",""],["Calvet","Nuria",""],["Espaillat","Catherine",""],["Sargent","Ben",""],["Hernandez","Jesus",""],["Forrest","William J.",""]]}

We show that this problem is in general ill-posed by providing\ncounterexamples for which the same potential corresponds to different positions\nand velocities of a same solid. However, it is also possible to find solids\nhaving a specific shape, like ellipses for instance, for which the problem of\ndetection admits a unique solution. Using complex analysis, we prove that the\nwell-posedness of the inverse problem is equivalent to the solvability of an\ninfinite set of nonlinear equations. This result allows us to show that when\nthe solid enjoys some symmetry properties, it can be partially detected.\nBesides, for any solid, the velocity can always be recovered when both the\npotential function and the position are supposed to be known.

These two figures differ from each other by the constitution of the edges\nin the interior part. That is, any edges in the interior part for one figure\nare not in the interior for the other figure.

Individually, neither of these\nrepresentations possess the features to easily determine the Hamiltonicity of\nthe graph. However, the combination of these two figures, once certain weights\nare assigned to their edges, allows us to determine the Hamiltonicity with a\npolynomial-time check. The rules for the assignment of weights are: 1. The\nweight of any edge of the interior part is 0, for both objects. 2. In both\nfigures any common edge of the contour has the same weight. The weights of the\nedges allow us to extend the number of parameters of the objects, that is\nsufficient to determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph.

The low resolution spectrum of GSC 02038-00293 clearly indicates\nthat it is a K-type star.

Two large flares, one in the Halpha\nobservations and one from the broadband photometry, and twelve smaller ones\nwere detected in V374 Peg during the observations spanning nine nights. The\nenergy of the photometrically detected largest flare is estimated to be\n4.25x10^31 - 4.3x10^32 ergs, depending on the waveband. Comparing the activity\npatterns in these two stars, which are just below and above the mass limit of\nfull convection, is crucial for understanding dynamo operation in stars with\ndifferent internal structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 19:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Korhonen","H.","","ESO"],["Vida","K.","","Konkoly Observatory"],["Husarik","M.","","Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences"],["Mahajan","S.","","University of Birmingham"],["Szczygiel","D.","","Ohio State University"],["Olah","K.","","Konkoly Observatory"]]}

Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular\nobserved value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a\ndistribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptive\nprior distribution . Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn\ndepends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being\nstudied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it\nto several \"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of\nM_T. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example,\neven for simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in\nan observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the\n0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of the\npower-law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively. Over the same range of\nindicies, the 95% confidence interval on M_T varies from 1.002-4.566 (alpha =\n-2) to 1.13-94.34 (alpha = +1) times larger than M_T sin(i) due to sin(i)\nuncertainty alone. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,\nboth individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)\nfactor as more than a \"numerical constant of order unity\" with simple and well\nunderstood statistical properties. We argue that reports of M_T sin(i)\ndeterminations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding\nconfidence bounds on M_T at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly stated\nassumed form of the true M_T distribution in order to more accurately reflect\nthe mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05","authors_parsed":[["Ho","Shirley",""],["Turner","Edwin L.",""]]}
