This model is based on the construction of\nan assembly graph containing all viable configurations of the community, and\nthe definition of a Markov chain whose transitions are the transformations of\ncommunities by new species invasions. In the present paper we provide an\nexhaustive numerical analysis of the model, describing the average time to the\nrecurrent state, the statistics of avalanches, and the dependence of the\nresults on the amount of available resource. Our results are based on the fact\nthat the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the\nrecurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well\nas the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact\nmanner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be\ncomparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in\nunits of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a\nfluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers\nwithout ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is\ndominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small\nextinction avalanches. Through the assembly process, communities become less\nresilient (e.g., have a higher return time to equilibrium) but become more\nrobust in terms of resistance against new invasions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 10:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2010 11:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18","authors_parsed":[["Capitan","Jose A.",""],["Cuesta","Jose A.",""],["Bascompte","Jordi",""]]}

Key to the success of\nplatforms required for open embedded systems is the achievement of both the\nscalable extension of base applications and the secure execution of open\napplications.

We want to obtain the regular (large scale) pattern of the magnetic\nfield distribution of the Milky Way that better fits the polarized synchrotron\nemission as seen by the 5-year WMAP data at 22 GHz. We have done a systematic\nstudy of a number of Galactic magnetic field models: axisymmetric, bisymmetric,\nlogarithmic spiral arms, concentric circular rings with reversals and\nbi-toroidal. We have explored the parameter space defining each of these models\nusing a grid-based approach. In total, more than one million models are\ncomputed. The model selection is done using a Bayesian approach. For each\nmodel, the posterior distributions are obtained and marginalised over the\nunwanted parameters to obtain the marginal 1-D probability distribution\nfunctions. In general, axisymmetric models provide a better description of the\nhalo component, although attending to their goodness-of-fit, the rest of the\nmodels cannot be rejected. In the case of disk component, the analysis is not\nvery sensitive for obtaining the disk large scale structure, because of the\neffective available area (less than 8% of the whole map and less than 40% of\nthe disk).

Monitoring a patient in his home environment is necessary to ensure\ncontinuity of care in home settings, but, to be useful, this activity must not\nbe too invasive for patients and a burden for caregivers. We prototyped a\nsystem called SINDI (Secure and INDependent lIving), focused on i) collecting a\nlimited amount of data about the person and the environment through Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSN), and ii) inferring from these data enough information to\nsupport caregivers in understanding patients' well being and in predicting\npossible evolutions of their health. Our hierarchical logic-based model of\nhealth combines data from different sources, sensor data, tests results,\ncommon-sense knowledge and patient's clinical profile at the lower level, and\ncorrelation rules between health conditions across upper levels. The logical\nformalization and the reasoning process are based on Answer Set Programming.\nThe expressive power of this logic programming paradigm makes it possible to\nreason about health evolution even when the available information is incomplete\nand potentially incoherent, while declarativity simplifies rules specification\nby caregivers and allows automatic encoding of knowledge.

Unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection is similar to\ncompact toroid injection but with much higher plasma density and total mass,\nand consequently lower required injection velocity. Mass deposition of the jet\ninto the background appears to be facilitated via magnetic reconnection along\nthe jet's trailing edge. The penetration depth of the plasma jet into the\nbackground plasma is mostly dependent on the jet's initial kinetic energy, and\na key requirement for spatially localized mass deposition is for the jet's\nslowing-down time to be less than the time for the perturbed background\nmagnetic flux to relax due to magnetic reconnection.

The system uses the\nfixed-queue-ratio-with-thresholds (FQR-T) control, which we proposed in a\nrecent paper as a way for one service system to help another in face of an\nunexpected overload. Under FQR-T, customers are served by their own service\npool until a threshold is exceeded. Then, one-way sharing is activated with\ncustomers from one class allowed to be served in both pools. After the control\nis activated, it aims to keep the two queues at a pre-specified fixed ratio.\nFor large systems that fixed ratio is achieved approximately. For the fluid\nlimit, or FWLLN, we consider a sequence of properly scaled X models in overload\noperating under FQR-T. Our proof of the FWLLN follows the compactness approach,\ni.e., we show that the sequence of scaled processes is tight, and then show\nthat all converging subsequences have the specified limit. The characterization\nstep is complicated because the queue-difference processes, which determine the\ncustomer-server assignments, remain stochastically bounded, and need to be\nconsidered without spatial scaling.

It is apparent that the latter are not\ndepending on the particle's charge, quantitatively. Based on this model, a\nconsiderable portion of the dynamics, that derives a charged particle parallel\nto a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ and under the influence of a force\n$\\mathbf{F}$, is assumed to be composed of an acceleration by a non-magnetic\nforce $\\mathbf{F}_{\\parallel}$ and a gyromotion along $\\mathbf{B}$ direction,\nplus drifts in the direction of $\\mathbf{F}_{\\perp}$. The model and its\nformalism are introduced. Various examples for drift motions and accelerating\nforces are suggested.

Using two special capacitors containing\nSodium vapor we find the electric susceptibility Xe of Na atoms is directly\nproportional to its density N, and inversely to the absolute temperature T, as\npolar molecules. Xe=A+B/T, where A is approximately to zero, B=126.6 (K) and\nN=1.49*1020 m-3. A ground state neutral Na atom has a large permanent EDM: d(\nNa)=1.28*10-8e.cm.

Self-consistent stellar evolution models of 1.3\nto 2.5 M_sun stars including atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations for\nall species within the OPAL opacity database were computed with mass loss and\ncompared to observations as well as previous calculations with turbulent\nmixing. Models with unseparated mass loss rates between 5 x 10^-14 and 10^-13\nM_sun/yr reproduce observations for many cluster AmFm stars as well as Sirius A\nand o Leonis. These models also explain cool Fm stars, but not the Hyades\nlithium gap. Like turbulent mixing, these mass loss rates reduce surface\nabundance anomalies; however, their effects are very different with respect to\ninternal abundances. For most of the main sequence lifetime of an A or F star,\nsurface abundances in the presence of such mass loss depend on separation which\ntakes place between log(Delta M/M_star)= -6 and -5. The current observational\nconstraints do not allow us to conclude that mass loss is to be preferred over\nturbulent mixing (induced by rotation or otherwise) in order to explain the\nAmFm phenomenon. Internal concentration variations which could be detectable\nthrough asteroseismic tests should provide further information. If atomic\ndiffusion coupled with mass loss are to explain the Hyades Li gap, the wind\nwould need to be separated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Vick","Mathieu",""],["Michaud","Georges",""],["Richer","Jacques",""],["Richard","Olivier",""]]}

The relationships between metallicity, star formation rate (SFR)\nand mid-infrared color in these systems show that the galaxies span a wide\nrange of properties. However, the galaxies do show a deficit of 8.0 \\um\\\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission as is apparent from the median 8.0\n\\um\\ luminosity which is only 0.004 \\lstarf\\ while the median $B$-band\nluminosity is 0.05 \\lstarb.

We show correlations between the [3.6] $-$ [8.0] color and luminosity,\nmetallicity, and to a lesser extent SFRs that were not evident in the original,\nsmaller sample studied previously. The luminosity--metallicity relation has a\nflatter slope for dwarf galaxies as has been indicated by previous work. We\nalso show a relationship between the 8.0 \\um\\ luminosity and the metallicity of\nthe galaxy which is not expected given the competing effects (stellar mass,\nstellar population age, and the hardness of the radiation field) that influence\nthe 8.0 \\um\\ emission.
