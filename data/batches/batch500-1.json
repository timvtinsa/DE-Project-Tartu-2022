Correlations between the emergence of new VLBI components\nfrom the core, flares in linearly polarized radio flux, and gamma-ray activity\nin bright EGRET-detected blazars supported a picture in which the gamma-ray and\nthe radio band emission arises in the same shocked region of the jet, with the\nhigh energy emission produced via inverse Compton scattering by the\nsynchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet. Quantitative tests of this scenario,\nhowever, were hampered by insufficient temporal sampling of the data and the\nsimple nature of the models adopted. The extensive data from Fermi coupled with\nthe wealth of well-sampled radio band data from old as well as new programs\nsuch as the F-GAMMA project now permit statistical studies for large numbers of\nsources, including weak HBLs, and detailed analyses of individual highly-active\nclass members.

The relay is\nassumed to operate over an orthogonal band with respect to the underlying IC,\nand the overall system is referred to as IC with an out-of-band relay (IC-OBR).\nThe system can be seen as operating over two parallel interference-limited\nchannels: The first is a standard Gaussian IC and the second is a Gaussian\nrelay channel characterized by two sources and destinations communicating\nthrough the relay without direct links. We refer to the second parallel channel\nas OBR Channel (OBRC). The main aim of this work is to identify conditions\nunder which optimal operation, in terms of the capacity region of the IC-OBR,\nentails either signal relaying and/or interference forwarding by the relay,\nwith either a separable or non-separable use of the two parallel channels, IC\nand OBRC. Here \"separable\" refers to transmission of independent information\nover the two constituent channels. For a basic model in which the OBRC consists\nof four orthogonal channels from sources to relay and from relay to\ndestinations (IC-OBR Type-I), a condition is identified under which signal\nrelaying and separable operation is optimal. When this condition is not\nsatisfied, various scenarios are identified in which interference forwarding\nand non-separable operation are necessary to achieve optimal performance. In\nthese scenarios, the system exploits the \"excess capacity\" on the OBRC via\ninterference forwarding to drive the IC-OBR system in specific interference\nregimes (strong or mixed). The analysis is then turned to a more complex\nIC-OBR, in which the OBRC consists of only two orthogonal channels, one from\nsources to relay and one from relay to destinations (IC-OBR Type-II). For this\nchannel, some capacity resuls are derived that parallel the conclusions for\nIC-OBR Type-I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Sahin","Onur",""],["Simeone","Osvaldo",""],["Erkip","Elza",""]]}

The limitation can be circumvented by\nexploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to\ncreate synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was\ndemonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments\non rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a\nmagnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum\nrotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the\ndifficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches\nare not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics.

We advance a natural\nconjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator\n[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is\nessentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of\nthe standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a\nquestion that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature\n[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture\nimplies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This\nentails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by\nsmall quantum circuits, whose row-supports are \"nearly-disjoint.\" (2) We give a\nsimple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any\nefficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can\nbe distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum\nalgorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a\nproblem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired\noracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's \"GLN conjecture\" [A10] implies our\nconjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture\nwas recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open\nfor depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an\noracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open\nproblem.

For a given set of conditions, one specific\nconfiguration may be better than another with respect to measures such as\nresource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were\nset dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was\nhypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to\nconverge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a\npriori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by\nadopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to\nthe peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed\nstorage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload\nand churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented\nusing a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The\nexperimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and\nsuggest several future research topics. The findings of this thesis could be\nexploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on\nharnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to\nbe exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 10:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Tauber","Markus",""]]}

We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for\ndifferent elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions. We assume that\nthe intrinsic contribution is independent of B, so that any B dependence of the\nphase curves is due to interparticle shadowing, which must also act similarly\nfor all colors. We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models\nto fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening. Eliminating the\nmodeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the\nopposition effect: for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent\nbackscattering; for the C ring, an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may\nalso be present.\n  Based on our simulations, the width of the interparticle shadowing effect is\nroughly proportional to B. This follows from the observation that as B\ndecreases, the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor\nupper ring layers, whereas at larger $B$'s the dense inner parts are visible.\nThe elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of\nthe B ring tilt effect (the increase of brightness with elevation). From\ncomparison of the magnitude of the tilt effect at different filters, we show\nthat multiple scattering can account for at most a 10% brightness increase as B\n-> 26^o, whereas the remaining 20% brightening is due to a variable degree of\ninterparticle shadowing. The negative tilt effect of the middle A ring is well\nexplained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the\nobserved A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 12:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Salo","Heikki",""],["French","Richard G.",""]]}

The derandomized\nversions produce again significantly better rounding errors, with running times\nstill negligible compared to the one for solving the corresponding LP. It thus\nseems worth preferring them over the randomized variants.\n  The data created in these experiments lets us propose and investigate the\nfollowing new ideas. For the low-congestion routing problems, we suggest to\nsolve a second LP, which yields the same congestion, but aims at producing a\nsolution that is easier to round. Experiments show that this reduces the\nrounding errors considerably, both in combination with randomized and\nderandomized rounding.\n  For the max-coverage instances, we generally observe that the greedy\nheuristics also performs very good. We develop a strengthened method of\nderandomized rounding, and a simple greedy/rounding hybrid approach using\ngreedy and LP-based rounding elements, and observe that both these improvements\nyield again better solutions than both earlier approaches on their own.\n  For unit disk max-domination, we also develop a PTAS.

GRB 080928 was a long burst detected by Swift/BAT and\nFermi/GBM. It is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission had\nalready been detected when the GRB itself was still radiating in the gamma-ray\nband. For nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray data\nprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient source\nfrom about 1 eV to 150 keV. In particular, we show that the SED during the main\nprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. We constructed the\noptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based on\nSwift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIa (Australia), and GROND (La Silla) data and compared it\nto the X-ray light curve retrieved from the Swift/XRT repository. We show that\nits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forward\nshock.Furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolution\nof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early X-ray light\ncurve can be explained by large-angle emission (LAE). We find that a\nnonstandard LAE model is required to explain the observations. Finally, we\nreport on the results of our search for the GRB host galaxy, for which only a\ndeep upper limit can be provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 15:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 20:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 16:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 20:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Rossi","A.",""],["Schulze","S.",""],["Klose","S.",""],["Kann","D.

Plutinos are those trans-Neptunian objects\nlocated at 39.5 AU, in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune. To do this,\nwe develop a statistical code that includes catastrophic collisions and\ncratering events, and takes into account the stability and instability zones of\nthe 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We proposes different initial\npopulations that account for the uncertainty in the size distribution of\nPlutinos at small sizes. Depending on the initial population, our results\nindicate the following. The number of D > 1 km Plutinos streaking Pluto over\n3.5 Gyr is between 1271 and 5552. For Charon, the number of D > 1 km Plutino\nimpactors is between 354 and 1545. The number of D > 1 km craters on Pluto\nproduced by Plutinos during the last 3.5 Gyr is between 43076 and 113879. For\nCharon, the number of D > 1 km craters is between 20351 and 50688.The largest\nPlutino impactor onto Pluto has a diameter between 17 and 23 km, which produces\na craterwith a diameter of 31 - 39 km. The largest Plutino impactor onto Charon\nhas a diameter between 10 and 15 km, which produces a crater with a diameter of\n24 - 33 km. We test if 2 Pluto-sized objects are assumed in the 3:2 Neptune\nresonance, then the total number of Plutino impactors both onto Pluto as Charon\nwith diameters D > 1 km is a factor of 1.6 - 1.8 larger if considering 1\nPluto-sized object. Given the dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian\nregion, it is necessary to study in detail the contribution of all the\npotential sources of impactors on the Pluto-Charon system, to obtain the main\ncontributor and the whole production of craters.

The initial conditions are either an X-point configuration\nembedded in 3D, the so-called Orszag-Tang vortex, or an\nArn'old-Beltrami-Childress configuration with a fully helical velocity and\nmagnetic field. In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one\nturn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation.

HS1603+3820 has\nbeen the target of a high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring campaign for more\nthan four years, aimed at studying its highly variable C IV mini-BAL profile.\nUsing the monitoring observations, in an earlier paper we were able to narrow\ndown the causes of the variability to the following two scenarios: (1)\nscattering material of variable optical depth redirecting photons around the\nabsorber, and (2) a variable, highly-ionized screen between the continuum\nsource and the absorber which modulates the UV continuum incident on the\nabsorber. The observations presented here provide a crucial test of the\nscattering scenario and lead us to disfavor it because (a) the polarization\nlevel is very small (p~0.6%) throughout the spectrum, and (b) the polarization\nlevel does not increase across the mini-BAL trough. Thus, the variable screen\nscenario emerges as our favored explanation of the C IV mini-BAL variability.\nOur conclusion is bolstered by recent X-ray observations of nearby mini-BAL\nquasars, which show a rapidly variable soft X-ray continuum that appears to be\nthe result of transmission through an ionized absorber of variable ionization\nparameter and optical depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 21:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Misawa","T.",""],["Kawabata","K.

Here\nwe present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation\nbut also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of\ninteracting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated\nby the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is\nchanged at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of\nthis poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory\ntool for wealth redistribution.

We find that our model\ndisplays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this\nexpansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI\nleaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which\naffects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate\ndeformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from\nmoderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be\nresponsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The\nsimulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the\npost-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the\nearly explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after\nshock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant\nprolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week\nafter the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta\nmorphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.\nSystematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced\nlate-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to\nwhich extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The\nimpact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei\nand the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional\nexplosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the\nentire sphere.

One of the basic\narguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays\nat zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual\nfriction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the\nvortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it\nis natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow\nof the energy, just as in the classical turbulence.

In the\npresent work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,\nwhich is not related to dissipation at small scales.

It turns out\nthat the mathematical problem underpinning both quantities is the computation\nof certain Hankel determinants generated by deformed versions of classical\nweight functions. For single-user MIMO systems, it is a deformed Laguerre\nweight, whereas for multi-user MIMO systems it is a deformed Jacobi weight. We\napply two different methods to characterize each of these Hankel determinants.\nFirst, we employ the ladder operators of the corresponding monic orthogonal\npolynomials to give an exact characterization of the Hankel determinants in\nterms of Painlev\\'{e} differential equations. This turns out to be a\nPainlev\\'{e} V for the single-user MIMO scenario and a Painlev\\'{e} VI for the\nmulti user scenario.

Whole-genome expression data over time\nprovides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are\naffected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore\nbe used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating\nlasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression\ndata. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying\ntime series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.\nMoreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between\nactivation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We\nprovide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show\nthat the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the\nlarge $p$, small $n$ setting.

The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel\nstate information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three\nlow complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the\nsum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first\nmethod allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the\nsum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally\namong the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is\nproposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference\nfrom other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not\nonly requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also\nrequires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of\npartitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems,\nrequiring no instantaneous channel knowledge.

Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for\na certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a\nspecial type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite\ncredit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute\nthe steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We\nshow that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nnetworks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus\nwe do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 22:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 01:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21","authors_parsed":[["Dandekar","Pranav",""],["Goel","Ashish",""],["Govindan","Ramesh",""],["Post","Ian",""]]}

The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness\nwhen remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB).\nResponsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality.\nMethod. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical\nstochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with\nminimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained\nis a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and\nthe request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole\ncommunication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are\nnecessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource\nmanagement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 11:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06","authors_parsed":[["Pentzaropoulos","G.

When\ncompared to junction-trees, we show that constructing block-tree graphs is\nfaster, and finding optimal block-tree graphs has a much smaller search space.\nApplying our block-tree graph framework to graphical models, we show that, for\nsome graphs, e.g., grid graphs, using block-tree graphs for inference is\ncomputationally more efficient than using junction-trees. For graphical models\nwith boundary conditions, the block-tree graph framework transforms the\nboundary valued problem into an initial value problem. For Gaussian graphical\nmodels, the block-tree graph framework leads to a linear state-space\nrepresentation. Since exact inference in graphical models can be\ncomputationally intractable, we propose to use spanning block-trees to derive\napproximate inference algorithms.

A\nprominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser\ninduces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The\nconcomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can\ngive rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of\nprobe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a\ncomplete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.\nHere, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally\nequivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved\nsideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the\ncavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of\nexcitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of\ntransparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature\nof EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the\nprobe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for\ndelaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations\nof optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be\ntailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical\nplatforms developed to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19","authors_parsed":[["Weis","S.",""],["Riviere","R.",""],["Deleglise","S.",""],["Gavartin","E.",""],["Arcizet","O.",""],["Schliesser","A.",""],["Kippenberg","T.

Individual agents make myopic\nlocal decisions via social learning, that is, each agent records a private\nobservation of a noisy underlying state process, selfishly optimizes its local\nutility and then broadcasts its local decision. Given these local decisions,\nhow can a global decision maker achieve quickest time change detection when the\nunderlying state changes according to a phase-type distribution? The paper\npresents four results. First, using Blackwell dominance of measures, it is\nshown that the optimal cost incurred in social learning based quickest\ndetection is always larger than that of classical quickest detection. Second,\nit is shown that in general the optimal decision policy for social learning\nbased quickest detection is characterized by multiple thresholds within the\nspace of Bayesian distributions. Third, using lattice programming and\nstochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are given for the optimal decision\npolicy to consist of a single linear hyperplane, or, more generally, a\nthreshold curve. Estimation of the optimal linear approximation to this\nthreshold curve is formulated as a simulation-based stochastic optimization\nproblem.

All the important effect of gas in laminar\ndisks are taken into account: the aerodynamic gas drag, the disk-planet\ninteraction including Type I migration, and the global disk potential which\ncauses inward migration of secular resonances as the gas dissipates. We vary\nthe initial total mass and spatial distribution of the planetesimals, the time\nscale of dissipation of nebular gas, and orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. We end\nup with one to five planets in the terrestrial region. In order to maintain\nsufficient mass in this region in the presence of Type I migration, the time\nscale of gas dissipation needs to be 1-2 Myr. The final configurations and\ncollisional histories strongly depend on the orbital eccentricity of Jupiter.\nIf today's eccentricity of Jupiter is used, then most of bodies in the\nasteroidal region are swept up within the terrestrial region owing to the\ninward migration of the secular resonance, and giant impacts between\nprotoplanets occur most commonly around 10 Myr. If the orbital eccentricity of\nJupiter is close to zero, as suggested in the Nice model, the effect of the\nsecular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a long\nperiod of time in the asteroidal region. With a circular orbit for Jupiter,\ngiant impacts usually occur around 100 Myr, consistent with the accretion time\nscale indicated from isotope records. However, we inevitably have an Earth size\nplanet at around 2 AU in this case.

Thus the ECKS gravity provides\na compelling alternative to speculative mechanisms of standard cosmic\ninflation.

By solving the Poisson equation with an\nassumed simple step-function distributions of the charge density in these two\nregions, the distribution of the electric field and the curvature radiation\nprocess of the accelerated particles can be calculated. In the our model, the\nproperties of the phase-averaged spectrum can be completely specified by three\ngap parameters, i.e. the fractional gap size in the outer magnetosphere, the\ngap current in the primary region and the gap size ratio between the primary\nregion and the total gap size.

Historically, the core had been assumed as an singular\nisothermal sphere (SIS), and the collapse had been investigated by a\nself-similar manner. This is while the rotation and magnetic field lead to\nnon-symmetric collapse so that a spheroid shape may be occurred. Here, the\nresultant of the centrifugal force and magnetic field gradient is assumed to be\nin the normal direction of the rotational axis, and its components are supposed\nto be a fraction $\\beta$ of the local gravitational force. In this research, a\ncollapsing SIS core is considered to find the importance of the parameter\n$\\beta$ for oblateness of the mass shells which are above the head of the\nexpansion wave. We apply the Adomian decomposition method to solve the system\nof nonlinear partial differential equations because the collapse does not occur\nin a spherical symmetry with self-similar behavior. In this way, we obtain a\nsemi-analytical relation for the mass infall rate $\\dot{M}$ of the shells at\nthe envelope. Near the rotational axis, the $\\dot{M}$ decreases with increasing\nof the non-dimensional radius $\\xi$, while a direct relation is observed\nbetween $\\dot{M}$ and $\\xi$ in the equatorial regions. Also, the values of\n$\\dot{M}$ in the polar regions are greater than the equatorial values, and this\ndifference is more often at smaller values of $\\xi$. Overall, the results show\nthat before reaching the head of expansion wave, the visible shape of the\nmolecular cloud cores can evolve to oblate spheroids. The ratio of major to\nminor axes of oblate cores increases with increasing the parameter $\\beta$, and\nits value can approach to the apparently observed elongated shapes of cores in\nthe maps of molecular clouds such as Taurus and Perseus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 07:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Nejad-Asghar","Mohsen",""]]}

We show that while standard sky subtraction techniques\nyield accuracies consistent with the Poisson noise limit for exposures of 1\nhour duration, there are large scale systematic defects that inhibit the\nsensitivity gains expected on the summation of longer duration exposures. For\nthe AAOmega system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope we identify a limiting\nsystematic sky subtraction accuracy which is reached after integration times of\n4-10 hours. We show that these systematic defects can be avoided through the\nuse of the fibre nod-and-shuffle observing mode, but with potential cost in\nobserving efficiency. Finally we demonstrate that these disadvantages can be\novercome through the application of a Principle Components Analysis sky\nsubtraction routine. Such an approach minimise systematic residuals across long\nduration exposures allowing deep integrations.\n  We apply the PCA approach to over 200 hours of on-sky observations and\nconclude that for the AAOmega system the residual error in long duration\nobservations falls at a rate proportional to t^-0.32 in contrast to the t^-0.5\nrate expected from theoretical considerations. With this modest rate of\ndecline, the PCA approach represents a more efficient mode of observation than\nthe nod-and-shuffle technique for observations in the sky limited regime with\ndurations of 10-100 hours (even before accounting for the additional\nsignal-to-noise and targeting efficiency losses often associated with the N+S\ntechnique).[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 09:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Sharp","Robert",""],["Parkinson","Hannah",""]]}

Although the time\nevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modelling\nstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate the\nformation of the protostar. Observing young stellar objects during these\nelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteady\naccretion. ZCMa is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embedded\nHerbig Be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a FU Orionis star. The\nHerbig Be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburst\ndetected so far. We aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studying\nthe emission region of the HI Brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer of\naccretion/ejection processes on the AU-scale in young stars. Using the\nAMBER/VLTI instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performed\nspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gas\nemitting across the Brackett gamma emission line, during and after the\noutburst. From the visibilities and differential phases, we derive\ncharacteristic sizes for the Brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometric\nmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. We find that the\nline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistent\nwith the signature of either a Keplerian disk or infall of matter. They are,\ninstead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk hole\ninside the dust sublimation radius. The disappearance of the Brackett gamma\nemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to a\nperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along the\nline of sight. Based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of the\noutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring in\nEX Ors and FU Ors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 13:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Benisty","M.",""],["Malbet","F.",""],["Dougados","C.",""],["Natta","A.",""],["Bouquin","J.

The three coefficients in the force\nand torque are fixed to reproduce the Boltzmann collisional rates of change of\nthe mean angular velocity and of the two granular temperatures (translational\nand rotational). A simpler version of the model is also constructed in the form\nof two coupled kinetic equations for the translational and rotational velocity\ndistributions.

M~33,\na local group spiral with a mass $\\sim 10$\\% and a metallicity half that of the\nGalaxy, represents a first step towards the metal poor Dwarf Galaxies. We have\nsearched for molecular clouds in the outer disk of M~33 and present here a set\nof detections of both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, including the only detections\n(for both lines) beyond the R$_{25}$ radius in a subsolar metallicity galaxy.\nThe spatial resolution enables mass estimates for the clouds and thus a measure\nof the $N({\\rm H}_2) / I_{\\rm CO}$ ratio, which in turn enables a more reliable\ncalculation of the H$_2$ mass.

In particular,\nCO detections were often not directly on local HI or FIR or H$\\alpha$ peaks,\nalthough generally in regions with FIR emission and high HI column density.

To this end, we must identify and\nexploit observables sensitive to weak magnetic fields (B<100 G) and to the\npresence of cool and hot gas in the bulk of the solar chromosphere. Here we\nreport on an investigation of the Hanle effect in two semi-empirical models of\nthe quiet solar atmosphere with different chromospheric thermal structures. Our\nstudy reveals that scattering polarization in the Ca II IR triplet has thermal\nand magnetic sensitivities potentially of great diagnostic value. The linear\npolarization in the 8498 A line shows a strong sensitivity to inclined magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 10 G, while the emergent linear\npolarization in the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is mainly sensitive to magnetic\nfields with strengths between 0.001 and 0.1 G. The reason for this is that the\nscattering polarization of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines, unlike the 8498 A line,\nis controlled mainly by the Hanle effect in their (metastable) lower levels.\nTherefore, in regions with magnetic strengths sensibly larger than 1 G, their\nStokes Q and U profiles are sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic\nfield vector. We also find that for given magnetic field configurations the\nsign of the Q/I and U/I profiles of the 8542 A and 8662 A lines is the same in\nboth atmospheric models, while the sign of the linear polarization profile of\nthe 8498 A line turns out to be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the\nlower chromosphere.

In this paper we propose a new definition for available\nbandwidth and a novel framework that addresses these issues. We define\nprobabilistic available bandwidth (PAB) as the largest input rate at which we\ncan send a traffic flow along a path while achieving, with specified\nprobability, an output rate that is almost as large as the input rate. PAB is\nexpressed directly in terms of the measurable output rate and includes\nadjustable parameters that allow the user to adapt to different application\nrequirements.
