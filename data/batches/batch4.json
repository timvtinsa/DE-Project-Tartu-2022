The derandomized\nversions produce again significantly better rounding errors, with running times\nstill negligible compared to the one for solving the corresponding LP. It thus\nseems worth preferring them over the randomized variants.\n  The data created in these experiments lets us propose and investigate the\nfollowing new ideas. For the low-congestion routing problems, we suggest to\nsolve a second LP, which yields the same congestion, but aims at producing a\nsolution that is easier to round. Experiments show that this reduces the\nrounding errors considerably, both in combination with randomized and\nderandomized rounding.\n  For the max-coverage instances, we generally observe that the greedy\nheuristics also performs very good. We develop a strengthened method of\nderandomized rounding, and a simple greedy/rounding hybrid approach using\ngreedy and LP-based rounding elements, and observe that both these improvements\nyield again better solutions than both earlier approaches on their own.\n  For unit disk max-domination, we also develop a PTAS.

We choose the Flow-Oriented Routing protocol (FORP), the\ntraffic interference based Load Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol and Min-Max\nBattery Cost Routing (MMBCR) as representatives of the stability-based routing,\nload-balancing and power-aware routing protocols respectively. Among the three\nrouting protocols, FORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR\nincurs the smallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet.\nEnergy consumed per node is the least for MMBCR, closely followed by LBR. MMBCR\nis the most fair in terms of node usage and hence it incurs the largest time\nfor first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the stable\npath and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols and it incurs\nthe smallest value for the time of first node failure. As we measure the\nfailure times of up to the first five nodes in the network, we observe that LBR\nincurs the maximum improvement in the lifetime of the nodes and MMBCR incurs\nthe least improvement beyond the time of first node failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Meghanathan","Natarajan",""],["Milton","Leslie",""]]}

To do this,\nwe develop a statistical code that includes catastrophic collisions and\ncratering events, and takes into account the stability and instability zones of\nthe 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We proposes different initial\npopulations that account for the uncertainty in the size distribution of\nPlutinos at small sizes. Depending on the initial population, our results\nindicate the following. The number of D > 1 km Plutinos streaking Pluto over\n3.5 Gyr is between 1271 and 5552. For Charon, the number of D > 1 km Plutino\nimpactors is between 354 and 1545. The number of D > 1 km craters on Pluto\nproduced by Plutinos during the last 3.5 Gyr is between 43076 and 113879.

In each case two snapshots are analyzed, separated by one\nturn-over time, starting just after the peak of dissipation.

The observations were carried out with the\nFOCAS instrument on the Subaru telescope and yielded an extremely high\npolarization sensitivity of 0.1%, at a resolving power of 1500. HS1603+3820 has\nbeen the target of a high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring campaign for more\nthan four years, aimed at studying its highly variable C IV mini-BAL profile.\nUsing the monitoring observations, in an earlier paper we were able to narrow\ndown the causes of the variability to the following two scenarios: (1)\nscattering material of variable optical depth redirecting photons around the\nabsorber, and (2) a variable, highly-ionized screen between the continuum\nsource and the absorber which modulates the UV continuum incident on the\nabsorber. The observations presented here provide a crucial test of the\nscattering scenario and lead us to disfavor it because (a) the polarization\nlevel is very small (p~0.6%) throughout the spectrum, and (b) the polarization\nlevel does not increase across the mini-BAL trough. Thus, the variable screen\nscenario emerges as our favored explanation of the C IV mini-BAL variability.\nOur conclusion is bolstered by recent X-ray observations of nearby mini-BAL\nquasars, which show a rapidly variable soft X-ray continuum that appears to be\nthe result of transmission through an ionized absorber of variable ionization\nparameter and optical depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 21:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Misawa","T.",""],["Kawabata","K.

A rather surprising amount of\ncomplex geometry carries over, almost untouched, and this has been the subject\nof many papers. We briefly review this material and, in particular, we discuss\nHermitian D-manifolds with trivial canonical bundle, which provide the\nbackground space for the geometry of split SLAG submanifolds.\n  A removable singularities result is proved for split SLAG subvarieties. It\nimplies, in particular, that there exist no split SLAG cones, smooth outside\nthe origin, other than planes. This is in sharp contrast to the complex case.\n  Parallel to the complex case, space-like Lagrangian submanifolds are\nstationary if and only if they are theta-split SLAG for some phase angle theta,\nand infinitesimal deformations of split SLAG submanifolds are characterized by\nharmonic 1-forms on the submanifold.\n  We also briefly review the recent work of Kim, McCann and Warren who have\nshown that split Special Lagrangian geometry is directly related to the\nMonge-Kantorovich mass transport problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 21:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12","authors_parsed":[["Harvey","F.
