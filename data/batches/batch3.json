Here\nwe present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation\nbut also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of\ninteracting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated\nby the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is\nchanged at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of\nthis poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory\ntool for wealth redistribution.

We find that our model\ndisplays a strong tendency to expand toward the pole. We demonstrate that this\nexpansion is a physical property of the low-mode, SASI instability. The SASI\nleaves behind a large lateral velocity gradient in the post shock layer which\naffects the evolution for minutes and hours later. This results in a prolate\ndeformation of the ejecta and a fast advection of Ni-rich material from\nmoderate latitudes to the polar regions. This effect might actually be\nresponsible for the global asymmetry of the nickel lines in SN 1987A. The\nsimulations demonstrate that significant radial and lateral motions in the\npost-shock region, produced by convective overturn and the SASI during the\nearly explosion phase, contribute to the evolution for minutes and hours after\nshock revival. They lead to both later clump formation, and a significant\nprolate deformation of the ejecta which are observed even as late as one week\nafter the explosion. As pointed out recently by Kjaer et al., such an ejecta\nmorphology is in good agreement with the observational data of SN 1987A.\nSystematic future studies are needed to investigate how the SASI-induced\nlate-time lateral expansion depends on the dominant mode of the SASI, and to\nwhich extent it is affected by the dimensionality of the simulations. The\nimpact on and importance of the SASI for the distribution of iron group nuclei\nand the morphology of the young SNR argues for future three-dimensional\nexplosion and post-explosion studies on singularity-free grids that cover the\nentire sphere.

Appreciating significance of the challenging problem of the\nclassical turbulence it can be expressed that the idea to study it in terms of\nquantized line is indeed very important and may be regarded as a breakthrough.\nFor this reason, this theory should be carefully scrutinized. One of the basic\narguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays\nat zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual\nfriction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the\nvortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it\nis natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow\nof the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent\nexperiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors\nattribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the\npresent work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,\nwhich is not related to dissipation at small scales. This mechanism is just the\ndiffusive like spreading of the vortex tangle. We discuss a number of the key\nexperiments, considering them both from the point of view of alternative\nexplanation and of the theory of Kolmogorov turbulence in quantum fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 08:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06","authors_parsed":[["Nemirovskii","Sergey K.",""],["Kondaurova","L.

It turns out\nthat the mathematical problem underpinning both quantities is the computation\nof certain Hankel determinants generated by deformed versions of classical\nweight functions. For single-user MIMO systems, it is a deformed Laguerre\nweight, whereas for multi-user MIMO systems it is a deformed Jacobi weight. We\napply two different methods to characterize each of these Hankel determinants.\nFirst, we employ the ladder operators of the corresponding monic orthogonal\npolynomials to give an exact characterization of the Hankel determinants in\nterms of Painlev\\'{e} differential equations. This turns out to be a\nPainlev\\'{e} V for the single-user MIMO scenario and a Painlev\\'{e} VI for the\nmulti user scenario. We then employ Coulomb fluid methods to derive new\nclosed-form approximations for the Hankel determinants which, although formally\nvalid for large matrix dimensions, are shown to give accurate results for both\nthe MIMO mutual information distribution and the error exponent even when the\nmatrix dimensions are small. Focusing on the single-user mutual information\ndistribution, we then employ both the exact Painlev\\'{e} representation and the\nCoulomb fluid approximation to yield deeper insights into the scaling behavior\nin terms of the number of antennas and signal-to-noise ratio. Among other\nthings, these results allow us to study the asymptotic Gaussianity of the\ndistribution as the number of antennas increase, and to explicitly compute the\ncorrection terms to the mean, variance, and higher order cumulants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 13:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-06","authors_parsed":[["Chen","Yang",""],["McKay","Matthew R.",""]]}

Such information can be used to improve estimation\nand inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular\nmechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an\nimportant problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time\nprovides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are\naffected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore\nbe used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating\nlasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression\ndata. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying\ntime series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.\nMoreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between\nactivation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We\nprovide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show\nthat the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the\nlarge $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is\nevaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples.

The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel\nstate information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three\nlow complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the\nsum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first\nmethod allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the\nsum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally\namong the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is\nproposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference\nfrom other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not\nonly requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also\nrequires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of\npartitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems,\nrequiring no instantaneous channel knowledge. Simulations show that the\nproposed greedy methods switch from time-division to interference alignment as\nthe coherence time of the channel increases, and have a small loss relative to\noptimal partitioning only at moderate coherence times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 21:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 18:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09","authors_parsed":[["Peters","Steven W.",""],["Heath","Robert W.","Jr"]]}

Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for\na certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a\nspecial type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite\ncredit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute\nthe steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We\nshow that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nnetworks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus\nwe do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jul 2010 22:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Feb 2011 01:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21","authors_parsed":[["Dandekar","Pranav",""],["Goel","Ashish",""],["Govindan","Ramesh",""],["Post","Ian",""]]}

The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical\nstochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with\nminimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users.

When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host.

Many biophysical models have been constructed to\nunderstand the mechanism of this motion. However, so far, the basic principle\nabout it remains unclosed. In this paper, based on the recent experimental\nresults and existing theoretical models, a spider-like model is provided. In\nthis model, each motor is regarded as a bead-spring system. The bead can bind\nto or unbind from the track stochastically, and step forward or backward with\nfixed step size L and force dependent transition rates. The spring connects the\nbead to cargo tightly. At any time, the position of cargo is determined by\nforce balance condition. The obvious characteristics of our model are that, the\nmotors interact with each other and they do not share the external load\nequally. Our results indicate, the stall force of cargo, under which the mean\nvelocity of cargo vanishes, usually decreases with the interactions between\nmotors. If the cargo is pulled by several motors from same motor species, the\nstall force of cargo is bigger than that of the single motor, but usually\nsmaller than their sum. However, if the cargo is pulled by two motors with\ndifferent directionality, the stall force of cargo might bigger or smaller than\nthe difference of the two single motor stall forces. The results imply,\ncooperation of several motors is helpful to pull big cargoes, though it is not\nso good as might be expected and no obvious help to improve the velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2010 15:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Zhang","Yunxin",""]]}
