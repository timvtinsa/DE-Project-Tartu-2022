In particular, in the current theoretical paradigm of\ngalaxy formation, AGN feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulating\nthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at low\nredshift. Only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical information\non the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass and\nhierarchy has become available. In this paper, we compare the fractions of\ngalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, AGN and radio\nactive) with predictions from four different and independently developed\nsemi-analytical models. We adopt empirical relations to convert physical\nproperties into observables (H_alpha emission lines, OIII line strength and\nradio power). We demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce the\noverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as a\nfunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongest\nradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-mass\ngalaxies/halos respectively. However, model predictions differ from\nobservational measurements in a number of ways. All models used in our study\npredict that almost every >1.e12 Msun dark matter halo and/or >1.e11 Msun\ngalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction of\ngalaxies belong to this class in the data. In addition, radio brightness is\nexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,\nwhile strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.\nOur results highlight that the distribution of AGN as a function of stellar\nmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gas\naccretion schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 20:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 13:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Fontanot","Fabio",""],["Pasquali","Anna",""],["De Lucia","Gabriella",""],["Bosch","Frank C. van den",""],["Somerville","Rachel S.",""],["Kang","Xi",""]]}

To verify the optical performance of\nthe instrument, extensive tests were performed at CEA on the flight model (FM)\nof the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM) at cryogenic temperatures and in the\ninfrared. This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at\n5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the\nPSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a\nmicroscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an\nover-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a\npoint source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct\nPSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native\nresolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were\n5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was\nidentified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror. After correction,\ntwo additional test campaigns were carried out, and we show that the shape of\nthe PSF is conform to expectations. The FWHM of the PSFs are 0.18-0.20 arcsec,\nin agreement with simulations. 56.1-59.2% of the total encircled energy\n(normalized to a 5 arcsec radius) is contained within the first dark Airy ring,\nover the whole field of view. At longer wavelengths (7.7-25.5 microns), this\npercentage is 57-68%. MIRIM is thus compliant with the optical quality\nrequirements. This characterization of the MIRIM PSF, as well as the\ndeconvolution method presented here, are of particular importance, not only for\nthe verification of the optical quality and the MIRI calibration, but also for\nscientific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 22:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Guillard","P.",""],["Rodet","T.",""],["Ronayette","S.",""],["Amiaux","J.",""],["Abergel","A.",""],["Moreau","V.",""],["Augueres","J.

The SMC's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows us\nto separate members from foreground stars.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the moss is\nunipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the\nmagnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line\ninclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field\nis mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux\nvariability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the\nmagnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because\nmost of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic\nflux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly\ndynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on\ntime-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from\nour extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some\nevidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G\n(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of\nlow-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of\nour simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find\nno clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes\nin the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most\nindividual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,\nrespectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy\nrequirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be\nsufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels\nmay be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Brooks","David H.",""],["Warren","Harry P.",""],["Winebarger","Amy R.",""]]}

As a result, at small-scales the\nbaryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional\nneutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai\nformulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations. Since T_e \\sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic\noscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely\nsuppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high\nwavenumber k.

Because the present study can trace the\n5'-scale spatial variation of the extinction, it has an advantage over the\nprevious studies, such as the one by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis, who used\nthe COBE/DIRBE data to derive the dust temperature distribution with a spatial\nresolution of 1^\\circ.

Supervisor: Graham Kirby","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SE","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to\ncomprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic\nbehaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide\nvariety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms\nand communication policies leads to ever more complex performance\ncharacteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour\nunder different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be\nconfigurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various\nstakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately\npredict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most\nappropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated\nexperiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can\nfind configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting\nbehavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's\nbehaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running\nsuch experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for\ndeciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is\ndiscussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have\nbeen used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for\nconfiguring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case\nstudy, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a\nproduct from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the\napplicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.\nTaguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-\nDirectory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to\nsystem administrators and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 08:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Sage","Aled",""]]}

These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks\nalong faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under\nthe assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning\ncan occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in\nsolar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells\nwith variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere\ntransforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by\ncontraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably\nformed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations\nonly weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial\nstrike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to\ndespinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking\nnorth-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is\nthinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion\nconsists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion\non a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation\nof the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and\ndespinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults\ndiffering in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to\nthe orientation of lobate scarps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 09:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09","authors_parsed":[["Beuthe","Mikael",""]]}

The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on\nthe length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous\nat low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place\nfluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as\na whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)\nthe system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domain\nstate, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the\nAsakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these\ntwo different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density\ndistribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak\nshape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium\ndomain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded)\ntransition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial\ncorrelation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder\ndiameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the\ntransition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of the\ncylindrical pore occurs.

We determine the scaling behavior of these lengths as a\nfunction of the velocity, temperature, driving force, and transverse\nperiodicity. A dynamical roughness diagram is thus obtained which contains, at\nsmall length scales, the critical and fast-flow regimes typical of the\nrandom-manifold (or domain wall) depinning, and at large length-scales, the\ncritical and fast-flow regimes typical of the random-periodic (or\ncharge-density wave) depinning.

Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the\nchoice of the stellar yields. We adopt a widely used model for the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellar\nnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical\nspecies. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis\nin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the model\npredictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak\nelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.\nThe main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models\nassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations\nare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova\nexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in\nmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of\nrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted\nrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the different\ntreatments of convection. Our results suggest that it is mandatory to include\nprocesses such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation in\nstars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution and\nnucleosynthesis. In spite of their importance, both these processes still have\nto be better understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova\nmodels computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature,\nbut they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results of\nexplosive nucleosynthesis computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Romano","D.",""],["Karakas","A.

We\nanalyse a total of 799 circularly-polarized spectra collected with the NARVAL\nand ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeters during 2008 and 2009. We employ a\ncross-correlation procedure to compute, from each spectrum, a mean polarized\nline profile with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20,000. The technique of\nZeeman-Doppler Imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of the\nstar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of Vega at two different\nepochs. We confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the mean\nline profiles. The amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines of\nhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for a\nsignal of magnetic origin. The short-term evolution of polarized signatures is\nconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \\pm 0.008 d.

The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15","authors_parsed":[["Khisti","Ashish",""],["Wornell","Gregory",""]]}

The power\nspectra of the temperature anisotropies and the $E$-mode polarization of the\nCMB are explained well by the inflationary paradigm. The next generation of CMB\nexperiments aim at providing the most direct evidence for inflation through the\ndetection of $B$-modes in the CMB polarization, presumed to have been caused by\ngravitational waves generated during the inflationary epoch around $10^{-34}$s.\nThe $B$-mode polarization signals are very small ($\\leq$10$^{-8}$K) compared\nwith the temperature anisotropies ($\\sim 10^{-4}$K). Systematic effects in CMB\ntelescopes can cause leakage from temperature anisotropy into polarization.\nBolometric interferometry (BI) is a novel approach to measuring this small\nsignal with lower leakage. If BI can be made to work over wide bandwidth\n($\\sim20-30\\%$) it can provide similar sensitivity to imagers. Subdividing the\nfrequency passband of a Fizeau interferometer would mitigate the problem of\n`fringe smearing.'

The density of defects after the sweep\ncan be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement. We argue that the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of an ion chain in a Paul trap constitutes an ideal\nscenario to test the inhomogeneous extension of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism,\nwhich lacks experimental evidence to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 17:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 10:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02","authors_parsed":[["De Chiara","Gabriele",""],["del Campo","Adolfo",""],["Morigi","Giovanna",""],["Plenio","Martin B.",""],["Retzker","Alex",""]]}

Satellite dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way are\nparticularly promising targets for this search. We find that current and\nnear-future ACTs have an excellent potential for discovering the FSR photons\nfrom dwarfs, although a discovery cannot be guaranteed due to large\nuncertainties in the fluxes resulting from lack of precise knowledge of dark\nmatter distribution within the dwarfs. We also investigate the possibility of\ndiscriminating between different dark matter models based on the measured FSR\nphoton spectrum. For typical parameters, we find that the ACTs can reliably\ndistinguish models predicting dark matter annihilation into two-lepton final\nstates from those favoring four-lepton final states (as in, for example, \"axion\nportal\" models).

It is also found that the often used Coulomb logarithm\n$\\ln M/m$ has to be revised to best fit the merging time-scales from\nsimulation.

The gate implements operation XNOR for low illumination, and it acts as\nNOR gate for high illumination. As a NOR gate is a universal gate then we are\nable to demonstrate that a simulated light sensitive BZ medium exhibits\ncomputational universality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 21:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26","authors_parsed":[["Adamatzky","Andrew",""],["Costello","Ben De Lacy",""],["Bull","Larry",""]]}

We study the problem of\ntesting convergence in the following settings and prove that the problem is\nhard in a computational sense: Given a Markov chain that mixes rapidly, it is\nhard for Statistical Zero Knowledge (SZK-hard) to distinguish whether starting\nfrom a given state, the chain is close to stationarity by time t or far from\nstationarity at time ct for a constant c. We show the problem is in AM\nintersect coAM. Second, given a Markov chain that mixes rapidly it is coNP-hard\nto distinguish whether it is close to stationarity by time t or far from\nstationarity at time ct for a constant c. The problem is in coAM. Finally, it\nis PSPACE-complete to distinguish whether the Markov chain is close to\nstationarity by time t or far from being mixed at time ct for c at least 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 07:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Bhatnagar","Nayantara",""],["Bogdanov","Andrej",""],["Mossel","Elchanan",""]]}

Results for both\ntwo mode condensates and the simpler single mode condensate case are presented.\nA hybrid phase space distribution functional method is used where the\ncondensate modes are described via a truncated Wigner representation, and the\nbasically unoccupied non-condensate modes are described via a positive P\nrepresentation. The Hamiltonian for the system is described in terms of quantum\nfield operators for the condensate and non-condensate modes. The functional\nFokker-Planck equation for the double phase space distribution functional is\nderived. Equivalent Ito stochastic equations for the condensate and\nnon-condensate fields that replace the field operators are obtained, and\nstochastic averages of products of these fields give the quantum correlation\nfunctions used to interpret interferometry experiments. The stochastic field\nequations are the sum of a deterministic term obtained from the drift vector in\nthe functional Fokker-Planck equation, and a noise field whose stochastic\nproperties are determined from the diffusion matrix in the functional\nFokker-Planck equation. The noise field stochastic properties are similar to\nthose for Gaussian-Markov processes in that the stochastic averages of odd\nnumbers of noise fields are zero and those for even numbers of noise field\nterms are sums of products of stochastic averages associated with pairs of\nnoise fields. However each pair is represented by an element of the diffusion\nmatrix rather than products of the noise fields themselves.

The\ngeneralized mean field theory solutions are needed for calculations using the\nIto stochastic field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 08:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 01:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24","authors_parsed":[["Dalton","B.

An HCP consists of\nan infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\\xi^{(n)}(\\cdot)}_{n\\ge1}$:\neach process occurs in a different \"epoch\" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an\ninfinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a\nway that the initial distribution of $\\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final\ndistribution of $\\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a\nsuitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent\nintervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to\na certain epoch-dependent finite range are active, that is, they can\nincorporate their left or right neighboring interval with quite general rates.\nInactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their\nlength only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges\nare such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes\ninactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any\nmean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a\nrenewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all\nfuture epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for\nexample, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior\nas $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates,\nactivity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the\nlimiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East\nmodel of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several\nsimulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the\nasymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear\nidentities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different\nepochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense\nlinearizes the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 05:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08","authors_parsed":[["Faggionato","Alessandra",""],["Martinelli","Fabio",""],["Roberto","Cyril",""],["Toninelli","Cristina",""]]}

The glitch occurred in 2009 November 5 (MJD 55140) and was\ncharacterized by a fractional increase in the rotation frequency of\nDeltanu/nu=1.3x10^{-6}. A large glitch happens in the pulsar whose rotation has\nunstable character. We present the results of the analysis of the rotation\nbehavior of this pulsar over the 30-year time span from 1979 to 2009. These\nresults show that the pulsar's rotation frequency underwent continuous, slow\noscillations which look like glitch-like events. During the 1991-2009 interval,\nthe pulsar experienced a continuous sequence of 12 slow glitches with a\nfractional increase in the rotation frequency Deltanu/nu=1.5x10^{-9}. All the\nslow glitches observed have a similar signature related to a slow increase in\nthe rotation frequency during 200 days and the subsequent relaxation back to\nthe pre-glitch value during 400 days.

Our analysis shows that the v sin i\ndistribution of stars with planets along the HR Diagram follows the well\nestablished scenario for the rotation of intermediate to low main sequence\nstars, with a sudden decline in rotation near 1.2Msun . The decline occurs\naround Teff~ 6000 K, corresponding to the late-F spectral region. A statistical\ncomparison of the distribution of the rotation of stars with planets and a\nsample of stars without planets indicates that the v sin i distribution for\nthese two families of stars is drawn from the same population distribution\nfunction. We also found that the angular momentum of extrasolar planet parent\nstars follows, at least qualitatively, Kraft's relation. The stars without\ndetected planets show a clear trend of angular momentum deficit compared to the\nstars with planets, in particular for masses higher than about 1.25 Msun .\nStars with the largest mass planets tend to have angular momentum comparable to\nor higher than the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 12:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 06:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Alves","S.",""],["Nascimento","J.

The temperature and density structure of the gas is\nvaried in order to differentiate between (i) simultaneous gas infall at a large\nrange of radii and (ii) the inside-out build-up of a disk. In all cases, the\ndisks go through phases of ring formation, gravitational instability and\nbreak-up into massive clumps. Ring formation can be enhanced by a focal point\neffect. The position of the ring is determined by the angular momentum\ndistribution of the material it forms from. We study the ring and clump\nmorphologies, the characteristic properties of the resulting velocity\ndispersion field and the effect of star formation. In the early phases, gas\naccretion leads to a high vertical velocity dispersion. We find that the disk\nfragmentation by gravitational instability and the subsequent clump-clump\ninteractions drive high velocity dispersions mainly in the plane of the disk\nwhile at the same time the vertical velocity dispersion dissipates. The result\nis a strong variation of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion with inclination\nangle. For a face-on view, clumps appear as minima in the (vertical)\ndispersion, whereas for a more edge-on view, they tend to correspond to maxima.\nThere exists observational evidence of a systematic variation of the velocity\ndispersion with inclination angle in high-redshift disks, which could be partly\nexplained by our simulation results. Additional energetic sources to drive\nvelocity dispersion that are not included in our models are also expected to\ncontribute to the observational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 13:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Aumer","Michael",""],["Burkert","Andreas",""],["Johansson","Peter H.",""],["Genzel","Reinhard",""]]}

In some sources the SSC component dominates the synchrotron peak by\none or more orders of magnitude implying that the electrons mainly cool by\ninverse Compton collisions with their self-made synchrotron photons. Therefore,\nthe linear synchrotron loss of electrons, which is normally invoked in emission\nmodels, has to be replaced by a nonlinear loss rate depending on an energy\nintegral of the electron distribution. This modified electron cooling changes\nsignificantly the emerging radiation spectra. It is the purpose of this work to\napply this new cooling scenario to relativistic power-law distributed\nelectrons, which are injected instantaneously into the jet. We will first solve\nthe differential equation of the volume-averaged differential number density of\nthe electrons, and then discuss their temporal evolution. Since any non-linear\ncooling will turn into linear cooling after some time, we also calculated the\nelectron number density for a combined cooling scenario consisting of both the\nlinear and non-linear cooling. For all cases, we will also calculate\nanalytically the emerging optically thin synchrotron fluence spectrum which\nwill be compared to a numerical solution. For small normalized frequencies f <\n1 the fluence spectra show constant spectral indices. We find for linear\ncooling a_SYN = 1/2, and for non-linear cooling a_SSC = 3/2. In the combined\ncooling scenario we obtain for the small injection parameter b_1 = 1/2, and for\nthe large injection parameter b_2 = 3/2, which becomes b_1 = 1/2 for very small\nfrequencies, again. This is the same behaviour as for monoenergetically\ninjected electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-17","authors_parsed":[["Zacharias","M.",""],["Schlickeiser","R.",""]]}

Radially averaging the squared\nmodulus of these Fourier transforms before peak fitting allows extraction of\ndominant length scales over the entire temperature range of the quench. Our\nprocedure even yields information just after droplet nucleation, when the\n(fluorescence) contrast between the two separating phases is scarcely\ndiscernable in the images. We find that our emulsions are stabilised on\nexperimental time scales by interfacial particles and that they are likely to\nhave bimodal droplet-size distributions. We attribute the latter to coalescence\ntogether with creaming being the main coarsening mechanism during the late\nstages of emulsification and we support this claim with (direct)\nconfocal-microscopy observations. In addition, our results imply that the\nobserved droplets emerge from particle-promoted nucleation, possibly followed\nby a free-growth regime.

The inherent weakness of those methods\nstems from the fact that the energy from P-wave is distributed among horizontal\nand vertical recording channels.

The neutrino-process is considered to\noccur in core-collapse supernovae and previous studies were limited to Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II). Although the progenitor star of an SN Ic does not posses a\nHe envelope so that 7Li production via the neutrino-process is unlikely, 11B\ncan be produced in the C-rich layers. We demonstrate a hydrodynamic simulation\nof SN Ic explosion and estimate the amounts of the light elements produced via\nthe neutrino-process for the first time, and also the subsequent spallation\nreactions between the outermost layers of compact SN Ic progenitor and the\nambient medium. We find that the neutrino-process in the current SN Ic model\nproduces a significant amount of 11B, which is diluted by 10B from spallation\nreactions to get closer to B isotopic ratios observed in meteorites. We also\nconfirm that high-temperature mu- and tau-neutrinos and their anti-neutrinos,\nreasonably suggested from the compact structure of SN Ic progenitors, enhance\nthe light element production through the neutral-current reactions, which may\nimply an important role of SNe Ic in the Galactic chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Nakamura","Ko",""],["Yoshida","Takashi",""],["Shigeyama","Toshikazu",""],["Kajino","Toshitaka",""]]}

Based on the SED shape and the assumption that\nit was produced by a single star and its disk, CoKu Tau/4 was classified as a\nprototypical transitional disk, with a clean inner hole possibly carved out by\na planet, some other orbiting body, or by photodissociation. However, recently\nit has been discovered that CoKu Tau/4 is a close binary system. This implies\nthat the observed mid-IR SED is probably produced by the circumbinary disk. The\naim of the present paper is to model the SED of CoKu Tau/4 as arising from the\ninner wall of a circumbinary disk, with parameters constrained by what is known\nabout the central stars and by a dynamical model for the interaction between\nthese stars and their surrounding disk. In order to fit the Spitzer IRS SED,\nthe binary orbit should be almost circular, implying a small mid-IR variability\n(10%) related to the variable distances of the stars to the inner wall of the\ncircumbinary disk. Our models suggest that the inner wall of CoKu Tau/4 is\nlocated at 1.7a, where a is the semi-major axis of the binary system (a~8AU). A\nsmall amount of optically thin dust in the hole (<0.01 lunar masses) helps to\nimprove the fit to the 10microns silicate band. Also, we find that water ice\nshould be absent or have a very small abundance (a dust to gas mass ratio\n<5.6X10^{-5}). In general, for a binary system with eccentricity e>0, the model\npredicts mid-IR variability with periods similar to orbital timescales,\nassuming that thermal equilibrium is reached instantaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 19:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Nagel","Erick",""],["D'Alessio","Paola",""],["Calvet","Nuria",""],["Espaillat","Catherine",""],["Sargent","Ben",""],["Hernandez","Jesus",""],["Forrest","William J.",""]]}

We show that this problem is in general ill-posed by providing\ncounterexamples for which the same potential corresponds to different positions\nand velocities of a same solid. However, it is also possible to find solids\nhaving a specific shape, like ellipses for instance, for which the problem of\ndetection admits a unique solution. Using complex analysis, we prove that the\nwell-posedness of the inverse problem is equivalent to the solvability of an\ninfinite set of nonlinear equations. This result allows us to show that when\nthe solid enjoys some symmetry properties, it can be partially detected.\nBesides, for any solid, the velocity can always be recovered when both the\npotential function and the position are supposed to be known.

For the purpose of HCP, we represent a graph by two such figures.\nIn each of them, there is an exterior part called the contour, and an interior\npart. These two figures differ from each other by the constitution of the edges\nin the interior part. That is, any edges in the interior part for one figure\nare not in the interior for the other figure. We call these two figures basic\nobjects. We develop rules and algorithms that allow us to represent any graph\nof degree d <= 3 by two basic objects. Individually, neither of these\nrepresentations possess the features to easily determine the Hamiltonicity of\nthe graph. However, the combination of these two figures, once certain weights\nare assigned to their edges, allows us to determine the Hamiltonicity with a\npolynomial-time check. The rules for the assignment of weights are: 1. The\nweight of any edge of the interior part is 0, for both objects. 2. In both\nfigures any common edge of the contour has the same weight. The weights of the\nedges allow us to extend the number of parameters of the objects, that is\nsufficient to determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph. Then, if the graph is\nHamiltonian, then both figures possess the same set of parameters. If the sets\nof parameters for two figures are different, then the graph is not Hamiltonian.\nThe parameters that determine the Hamiltonicity of the graph are the sums of\nweights of edges and windows of contours in the figure.

Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular\nobserved value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a\ndistribution corresponding to an isotropic i distribution, i.e. the presumptive\nprior distribution . Rather, the posterior distribution from which it is drawn\ndepends on the intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being\nstudied. We give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it\nto several \"toy models\" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of\nM_T. The results show that the effect can be an important one. For example,\neven for simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in\nan observed RV sample can vary between 0.860 and 0.023 (as compared to the\n0.866 value for an isotropic i distribution) for indices (alpha) of the\npower-law in the range between -2 and +1, respectively.

We argue that reports of M_T sin(i)\ndeterminations should be accompanied by a statement of the corresponding\nconfidence bounds on M_T at, say, the 95% level based on an explicitly stated\nassumed form of the true M_T distribution in order to more accurately reflect\nthe mass uncertainties associated with RV studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-05","authors_parsed":[["Ho","Shirley",""],["Turner","Edwin L.",""]]}

The results are confirmed by separate numerical\ncomputations.\n  In the Appendix, we study the effect of a neutral scalar field on the\nfermionic spectral functions. A suitable interaction term shifts the original\nspin-up / spin-down Fermi momenta in opposite directions and thus the two nodal\npoints of the p-wave gap extend into Fermi pockets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Vegh","David",""]]}

In a previous work, we\ndiscussed Chandra and Swift observations obtained during the first five months\nafter this transition. Here, we report on further X-ray observations of EXO\n0748-676, extending the quiescent monitoring to 1.6 years. Chandra and\nXMM-Newton data reveal quiescent X-ray spectra composed of a soft, thermal\ncomponent that is well-fitted by a neutron star atmosphere model. An additional\nhard powerlaw tail is detected that changes non-monotonically over time,\ncontributing between 4 and 20 percent to the total unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux.\nThe combined set of Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift data reveals that the thermal\nbolometric luminosity fades from ~1E34 to 6E33 (D/7.4 kpc)^2 erg/s, whereas the\ninferred neutron star effective temperature decreases from ~124 to 109 eV. We\ninterpret the observed decay as cooling of the neutron star crust and show that\nthe fractional quiescent temperature change of EXO 0748-676 is markedly smaller\nthan observed for three other neutron star X-ray binaries that underwent\nprolonged accretion outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2010 15:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Degenaar","N.",""],["Wolff","M.

All these sources are known to undergo very faint X-ray\noutbursts with 2-10 keV peak luminosities of Lx,peak~1E34-1E36 erg/s, although\nthe two confirmed neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries AX J1745.6-2901 and GRS\n1741-2853 can also become brighter (Lx,peak~1E36-1E37 erg/s). We discuss the\nobserved long-term lightcurves and X-ray spectra of these five enigmatic\ntransients. In 2008, AX J1745.6-2901 returned to quiescence following an\nunusually long accretion outburst of more than 1.5 years.
