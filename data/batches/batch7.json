In this work theoretical and numerical methods for\nconstraining the parameter space of a wide class of such models are described.\nFirst, string-theoretic models with large non-Gaussian signatures are\ninvestigated. An upper bound is placed on the amplitude of primordial\ngravitational waves produced by ultra-violet Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation. In\nall but the most finely tuned cases, this bound is incompatible with a lower\nbound derived for inflationary models which exhibit a red spectrum and\ndetectable non-Gaussianity. By analysing general non-canonical actions, a class\nof models is found which can evade the upper bound when the phase speed of\nperturbations is small. The multi-coincident brane scenario with a finite\nnumber of branes is one such model. For models with a potentially observable\ngravitational wave spectrum the number of coincident branes is shown to take\nonly small values. The second method of constraining inflationary models is the\nnumerical calculation of second order perturbations for a general class of\nsingle field models. The Klein-Gordon equation at second order, written in\nterms of scalar field variations only, is numerically solved. The slow roll\nversion of the second order source term is used and the method is shown to be\nextendable to the full equation. This procedure allows the evolution of second\norder perturbations in general and the calculation of the non-Gaussianity\nparameter in cases where there is no analytical solution available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2010 11:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29","authors_parsed":[["Huston","Ian",""]]}

From X-ray spectroscopy, we estimate the masses of nearby WDs in\nmoderately-magnetized CVs, or Intermediate Polars (IPs).\n  Methods. Using the Suzaku satellite, we aquired wide-band spectra of 17 IPs,\ncovering 3-50 keV. An accretion column model of Suleimanov et al.

We determined the WD masses of the 17 IPs with statistical fitting\nerrors of ~0.1-0.2 Msun in many cases. The WD mass of a recently-found IP, IGR\nJ17195-4100, was also estimated for the first time (1.03+0.24-0.22 Msun). The\naverage WD mass of the sample is 0.88 \\pm 0.25 Msun.

It describes the motion of $N$ particles moving on a\nring, coupled through an infinite-range potential. The model has a second order\nphase transition at the energy $U_c=3/4$ and its dynamics is exactly described\nby the Vlasov equation in the $N \\to \\infty$ limit. Its chaotic properties have\nbeen investigated in the past, but the determination of the scaling with $N$ of\nthe Lyapunov Spectrum (LS) of the model remains a challenging open problem. We\nhere show that the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling of the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent (MLE),\nfound in previous numerical and analytical studies, extends to the full LS; not\nonly, scaling is \"precocious\" for the LS, meaning that it becomes manifest for\na much smaller number of particles than the one needed to check the scaling for\nthe MLE. Besides that, the $N^{-1/3}$ scaling appears to be valid not only for\n$U>U_c$, as suggested by theoretical approaches based on a random matrix\napproximation, but also below a threshold energy $U_t \\approx 0.2$. Using a\nrecently proposed method (GALI) devised to rapidly check the chaotic or regular\nnature of an orbit, we find that $U_t$ is also the energy at which a sharp\ntransition from {\\it weak} to {\\it strong} chaos is present in the phase-space\nof the model.

The origin is globally stable if R < R_{sn} but for R > R_{sn} has\ntwo further equilibrium points, X_{lb} and X_{ub} . Of these X_{lb} is unstable\nfor all values of R > R_{sn} whereas X_{ub} is stable for R < R_{bh} and\ntherefore possesses its own basin of attraction D. At R = R_h a homoclinic\nbifurcation takes place with the simultaneous formation of a homoclinic loop\nand an edge state.\n  For R_h < R < R_{bh} the edge state, which is the stable manifold of X_{lb},\nforms part of \\partial B, the boundary of the basin of attraction of the\norigin. The other part of \\partial B is a periodic orbit P bounding D. P and D\nshrink with increasing R. At R = R_{bh} there is a 'backwards Hopf' bifurcation\nat which X_{ub} loses its stability and P and D disappear. For R_{bh} < R <\nR_\\infty the edge is 'pure' in the sense that it is the only phase space\nstructure that lies outside the basin of attraction of the origin. As R\nincreases the point X_{lb} recedes to progressively greater distances, with a\nsingularity at R = R_\\infty where it becomes infinite. For R > R_\\infty X_{lb}\nhas reappeared, the edge state has disappeared, and the geometrical structure\nfavors permanent transition from the laminar state, increasingly so for\nincreasing values of R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2010 02:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-29","authors_parsed":[["Lebovitz","Norman R.",""]]}

We\nstudy the effects of thermohaline instability and rotation-induced mixing in\nthe 1-4 Msun range at solar metallicity. We present evolutionary models by\nconsidering both thermohaline and rotation-induced mixing in stellar interior.\nWe discuss the effects of these processes on the chemical properties of stars\nfrom the zero age main sequence up to the end of the second dredge-up on the\nearly-AGB for intermediate-mass stars and up to the AGB tip for low-mass stars.\nModel predictions are compared to observational data for\nlithium,12C/13C,[N/C],[Na/Fe],16O/17O, and 16O/18O in Galactic open clusters\nand in field stars with well-defined evolutionary status,as well as in\nplanetary nebulae. Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed\nbehaviour of 12C/13C,[N/C], and lithium in low-mass stars that are more\nluminous than the RGB bump, and its efficiency is increasing with decreasing\ninitial stellar mass. On the TP-AGB,thermohaline mixing leads to lithium\nproduction, although the 7Li yields remain negative. Although the 3He stellar\nyields are much reduced thanks to this process, we find that solar-metallicity,\nlow-mass stars remain net 3He producers. Rotation-induced mixing is found to\nchange the stellar structure so that in the mass range between \\sim 1.5 and 2.2\nMsun the thermohaline instability occurs earlier on the red giant branch than\nin non-rotating models.

Following the\napproach by Ralko et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 117204 (2008)] for the square\nand triangular lattices, we introduce the (minimal) extension of the QDM on the\nKagome lattice to account for spontaneous creation of mobile S=1/2 spinons at\nfinite magnetic field. Modulations of the dimer density (at zero or finite\nmagnetic field) and of the local field-induced magnetization in the vicinity of\nimpurities are computed using Lanczos Exact Diagonalization techniques on small\nclusters (48 and 75 sites). The VBC is clearly revealed from its pinning by\nimpurities, while, in the dimer liquid, crystallization around impurities\ninvolves only two neighboring dimers. We also find that a next-nearest-neighbor\nferromagnetic coupling favors VBC order. Unexpectedly, a small size\nspinon-impurity bound state appears in some region of the the dimer liquid\nphase. In contrast, in the VBC phase the spinon delocalizes within a large\nregion around the impurity, revealing the weakness of the VBC confining\npotential. Lastly, we observe that an impurity concentration as small as 4%\nenhances dimerization substantially. These results are confronted to the\nValence Bond Glass scenario [R.R.P. Singh, Phys. Rev.

We used\nthe 10' x 10' Minimosaic Imager to observe the galaxies in BVR filters to\nprojected radii of ~20 kpc from the galaxy centers. We combined the WIYN data\nwith archival and published data from WFPC2 and ACS on the Hubble Space\nTelescope to assess the contamination level of the WIYN GC candidate sample and\nto follow the GC systems further in toward the galaxies' centers. We\nconstructed radial distributions for the GC systems using both the WIYN and HST\ndata. The GC systems of NGC891 and NGC4013 extend to 9+/-3 kpc and 14+/-5 kpc,\nrespectively, before falling off to undetectable levels in our images. We use\nthe radial distributions to calculate global values for the total number (N_GC)\nand specific frequencies (S_N and T) of GCs. NGC4013 has N_GC = 140+/-20, S_N =\n1.0+/-0.2 and T = 1.9+/-0.5; our N_GC value is ~40% smaller than a previous\ndetermination from the literature. The HST data were especially useful for\nNGC891, because the GC system is concentrated toward the plane of the galaxy\nand was only weakly detected in our WIYN images. Although NGC891 is thought to\nresemble the Milky Way in its overall properties, it has only half as many GCs,\nwith N_GC = 70+/-20, S_N = 0.3+/-0.1 and T = 0.6+/-0.3. We also calculate the\ngalaxy-mass-normalized number of blue (metal-poor) GCs in NGC891 and NGC4013\nand find that they fall along a general trend of increasing specific frequency\nof blue GCs with increasing galaxy mass. Given currently available resources,\nthe optimal method for studying the global properties of extragalactic GC\nsystems is to combine HST data with wide-field, ground-based imaging with good\nresolution.

The jet was successfully\ndetected in both molecular and atomic lines. The H_2 component was found to be\nentirely blueshifted around the base of the bipolar jet. It shows that only the\nblue lobe is emitting in H_2 while light is scattered in the direction of the\nred lobe, highlighting an asymmetric extinction and/or excitation between the\ntwo lobes. Consistent with this view, the red lobe is brighter in all atomic\nlines. Interestingly, the jet was detected not only in [Fe II], but also in Br\ngamma and Pa beta lines.

Here, the theory of electronic Raman\nscattering in a superconductor by Klein and Dierker (1984) is extended to a\nmultiband superconductor. Raman scattering creates particle/hole pairs. In the\nrelevant $A_{1g}$\\ symmetry, the attraction that produces pairing necessarily\ncouples excitations of superconducting pairs to these p/h excitations. In the\nAppendix it is shown that for zero wave vector transfer $% q$ this coupling\nmodifies the Raman response and makes the long-range Coulomb correction null.\nThe 2-band result is applied to MgB$_{2}$ where this coupling activates\nLeggett's collective mode. His simple limiting case is obtained when the\ninterband attractive potential is decreased to a value well below that given by\nLDA theory. The peak from Leggett's mode is studied as the potential is\nincreased through the theoretical value: With realistic MgB$_{2}$\\ parameters,\nthe peak broadens through decay into the continuum above the smaller ($\\pi $\nband) superconducting gap.

Unlike the mean specific star\nformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surface\ndensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across the\nsample with a value close to SFE = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gas\nconsumption timescale of ~3 Gyr).

An investigation into the detailed distribution\nof SFEs reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencies\nwith SFE > 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to a\ndeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate.

The equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of bulges\nwere obtained from the length of the apparent major and minor semi-axes of the\nbulge, twist angle between the apparent major axis of the bulge and the galaxy\nline of nodes, and galaxy inclination.

We measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter of\nthe rest-frame U-V colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. This scatter in\ncolor arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we see\nboth relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, younger\ngalaxies towards higher redshift. The trends between color and age are\nconsistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of these galaxies. The composite SEDs of the reddest and bluest\nquiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined\n4000A- and Balmer-breaks, respectively.

In this paper we\nshed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low mass galaxy by\npresenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of\nQ2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z=2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and\nunusual properties: BX418 is young (<100 Myr), low mass (M_star ~ 10^9 Msun),\nlow in metallicity (Z ~ 1/6 Zsun), and unreddened (E(B-V)~0.02, UV continuum\nslope beta=-2.1).

The mass of CoRoT-7b is a crucial parameter for planet\nstructure models, but is difficult to determine because CoRoT-7 is a modestly\nactive star and there is at least one additional companion.

With the discovery of many hot Jupiter\nplanets orbiting nearby stars, this motivates the development of robust methods\nof characterisation from follow up observations. In this paper we discuss two\nmethods for determining the planetary albedo in transiting systems. First, the\nmost widely used method for measuring the light scattered by hot Jupiters\n(Collier Cameron et al.) is investigated for application for typical echelle\nspectra of a transiting planet system, showing that detection requires high\nsignal-to-noise ratio data of bright planets. Secondly a new Fourier analysis\nmethod is also presented, which is model-independent and utilises the benefits\nof the reduced number of unknown parameters in transiting systems. This\napproach involves solving for the planet and stellar spectra in Fourier space\nby least-squares. The sensitivities of the methods are determined via Monte\nCarlo simulations for a range of planet-to-star fluxes. We find the Fourier\nanalysis method to be better suited to the ideal case of typical observations\nof a well constrained transiting system than the Collier Cameron et al. method.\nWe apply the Fourier analysis method for extracting the light scattered by\ntransiting hot Jupiters from high resolution spectra to echelle spectra of HD\n209458 and HD 189733.

However,\nas an outcome of its low cost, RFID based inventory control is susceptible to\npernicious security and privacy threats. A deleterious attack on such a system\nis corporate espionage, where attackers through illicit inventorying infer\nsales and restocking trends for products. In this paper, we first present\nplausible aftermaths of corporate espionage using real data from online\nsources. Second, to mitigate corporate espionage in a retail store environment,\nwe present a simple lowcost system called Mirage. Mirage uses additional\nprogrammable low cost passive RFID tags called honeytokens to inject noise in\nretail store inven-torying. Using a simple history based algorithm that\ncontrols activation and de-activation of honeytokens, Mirage randomizes sales\nand restocking trends. We evaluate Mirage in a real warehouse environment using\na commercial off-the-shelf Motorola MC9090 handheld RFID reader and over 450\nGen2 low cost RFID tags.

We argue that a triadic\nconceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the\ninformation generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,\nand propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply\ninfluenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,\nwe elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and\nmodern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions\nto the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures\ninvolve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,\nformal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles\nas primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of\nthermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are\nsystems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this\nview, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy\nProduction work together to drive the emergence of information carrying\nstructures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the\ngradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's\nseminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical\nexpression of the Second Law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 04:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-06-30","authors_parsed":[["Herrmann-Pillath","Carsten",""],["Salthe","Stanley N.",""]]}

We also find that telescope\ndiffraction has important effects on the spectra coming from very high\nresolution observations of inhomogeneous atmospheres. Diffration reduces the\namplitude of the polarization signals and changes the asymmetry of the Stokes\nprofiles. The two Fe I lines at 525 nm meet the scientific requirements of\nIMaX, but Fe I 525.02 nm is to be preferred because it leads to smaller\nuncertainties in the retrieved parameters and offers a better detectability of\nthe weakest (linear) polarization signals prevailing in the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 06:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Su\u00e1rez","D.
