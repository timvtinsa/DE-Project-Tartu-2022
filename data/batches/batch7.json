We find a clear lateral displacement of sunspot penumbral regions\nscanned by two flare ribbons. In the impulsive phase of the flare, the flare\nribbons scan the sunspot at a speed of around 18 km/s, derived from Ca II and\nG-band images. We find instantaneous horizontal shear of penumbral fibrils,\nwith initial velocities of about 1.6 km/s, produced when a flare ribbon passes\nover them. This velocity decreases rapidly at first, then gradually decays, so\nthat about one hour later, the fibrils return to a new equilibrium. During the\none hour interval, the total displacement of these fibrils is around 2.0 Mm,\nwith an average shear velocity of 0.55 km/s. This lateral motion of the\npenumbral fibrils indicates that the magnetic footpoints of these field lines\nbeing rearranged in the corona also move.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 02:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Zhang","Jun",""],["Li","Leping",""],["Solanki","S.

We show that $F_{d,n}$ is finite\ndimensional and the \\lq braid generators\\rq\\ of this algebra satisfy a quartic\nrelation which is of minimal degree not containing the generators $t_i$. They\nalso satisfy a quintic relation, as the smallest closed relation. We conjecture\nthat the algebras $F_{d,n}$ support a Markov trace which allow to define\npolynomial invariants for unoriented knots in an analogous way that the\nKauffman polynomial is derived from the BMW algebra.\n  The idea originates from the Yokonuma--Hecke algebra, built from the\nclassical Hecke algebra by adding framing generators and changing the Hecke\nalgebra quadratic relation by a new quadratic relation which involves the\nframing generators. Using the Yokonuma--Hecke algebras and a Markov trace\nconstructed on them\\cite{ju} we produced invariants for oriented framed\nknots\\cite{jula1,jula3}, classical knots\\cite{jula4} (which satisfies a cubic\nskein relation), and singular knots\\cite{jula2}. Moreover, we have connections\nwith virtual braids and transversal knot theory. In this note we also apply the\nframization mechanism on other knot algebras, such as the Temperley--Lieb\nalgebra, the singular Hecke algebra introduced by Paris and Rabenda and Hecke\nalgebras of type $B$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 07:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Juyumaya","Jesus",""],["Lambropoulou","Sofia",""]]}

Results for both\ntwo mode condensates and the simpler single mode condensate case are presented.\nA hybrid phase space distribution functional method is used where the\ncondensate modes are described via a truncated Wigner representation, and the\nbasically unoccupied non-condensate modes are described via a positive P\nrepresentation. The Hamiltonian for the system is described in terms of quantum\nfield operators for the condensate and non-condensate modes. The functional\nFokker-Planck equation for the double phase space distribution functional is\nderived. Equivalent Ito stochastic equations for the condensate and\nnon-condensate fields that replace the field operators are obtained, and\nstochastic averages of products of these fields give the quantum correlation\nfunctions used to interpret interferometry experiments. The stochastic field\nequations are the sum of a deterministic term obtained from the drift vector in\nthe functional Fokker-Planck equation, and a noise field whose stochastic\nproperties are determined from the diffusion matrix in the functional\nFokker-Planck equation. The noise field stochastic properties are similar to\nthose for Gaussian-Markov processes in that the stochastic averages of odd\nnumbers of noise fields are zero and those for even numbers of noise field\nterms are sums of products of stochastic averages associated with pairs of\nnoise fields. However each pair is represented by an element of the diffusion\nmatrix rather than products of the noise fields themselves. The treatment\nstarts from a generalised mean field theory for two condensate mode. The\ngeneralized mean field theory solutions are needed for calculations using the\nIto stochastic field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 08:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2010 01:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24","authors_parsed":[["Dalton","B.

An HCP consists of\nan infinite sequence of coalescence processes ${\\xi^{(n)}(\\cdot)}_{n\\ge1}$:\neach process occurs in a different \"epoch\" (indexed by $n$) and evolves for an\ninfinite time, while the evolution in subsequent epochs are linked in such a\nway that the initial distribution of $\\xi^{(n+1)}$ coincides with the final\ndistribution of $\\xi^{(n)}$. Inside each epoch the process, described by a\nsuitable simple point process representing the boundaries between adjacent\nintervals (domains), evolves as follows. Only intervals whose length belongs to\na certain epoch-dependent finite range are active, that is, they can\nincorporate their left or right neighboring interval with quite general rates.\nInactive intervals cannot incorporate their neighbors and can increase their\nlength only if they are incorporated by active neighbors. The activity ranges\nare such that after a merging step the newly produced interval always becomes\ninactive for that epoch but active for some future epoch. Without making any\nmean-field assumption we show that: (i) if the initial distribution describes a\nrenewal process, then such a property is preserved at all later times and all\nfuture epochs; (ii) the distribution of certain rescaled variables, for\nexample, the domain length, has a well-defined and universal limiting behavior\nas $n\\to \\infty$ independent of the details of the process (merging rates,\nactivity ranges$,...$). This last result explains the universality in the\nlimiting behavior of several very different physical systems (e.g., the East\nmodel of glassy dynamics or the Paste-all model) which was observed in several\nsimulations and analyzed in many physics papers. The main idea to obtain the\nasymptotic result is to first write down a recursive set of nonlinear\nidentities for the Laplace transforms of the relevant quantities on different\nepochs and then to solve it by means of a transformation which in some sense\nlinearizes the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 05:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08","authors_parsed":[["Faggionato","Alessandra",""],["Martinelli","Fabio",""],["Roberto","Cyril",""],["Toninelli","Cristina",""]]}

We present and\nanalyse a high-resolution (R = 21 000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with the\nSubaru Telescope in June 2009. Various components (stellar-like continuum,\natomic emission lines, molecular bands in emission) in the spectrum are\nanalysed and discussed. We also investigate a global spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the object mostly derived from broadband optical and\ninfrared photometry. The observed continuum resembles that of an M6 giant. The\nemission features (atomic and molecular) are most probably produced by\nradiative pumping. The observed strengths of the emission features strongly\nsuggest that we only observe a small part of the radiation of the main object\nresponsible for pumping the emission features. An infrared component seen in\nthe observed SED, which can be roughly approximated by two blackbodies of 950\nand 200 K, is 50 times brighter than the M6 stellar component seen in the\noptical.

The main object in V4332 Sgr, an M6 (super)giant, is surrounded by a\ncircumstellar disc, which is seen almost edge-on so the central star is\nobscured.
