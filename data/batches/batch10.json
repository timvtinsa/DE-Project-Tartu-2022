In particular, in the current theoretical paradigm of\ngalaxy formation, AGN feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulating\nthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at low\nredshift. Only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical information\non the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass and\nhierarchy has become available. In this paper, we compare the fractions of\ngalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, AGN and radio\nactive) with predictions from four different and independently developed\nsemi-analytical models. We adopt empirical relations to convert physical\nproperties into observables (H_alpha emission lines, OIII line strength and\nradio power). We demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce the\noverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as a\nfunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongest\nradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-mass\ngalaxies/halos respectively. However, model predictions differ from\nobservational measurements in a number of ways. All models used in our study\npredict that almost every >1.e12 Msun dark matter halo and/or >1.e11 Msun\ngalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction of\ngalaxies belong to this class in the data. In addition, radio brightness is\nexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,\nwhile strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.\nOur results highlight that the distribution of AGN as a function of stellar\nmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gas\naccretion schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 20:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 13:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Fontanot","Fabio",""],["Pasquali","Anna",""],["De Lucia","Gabriella",""],["Bosch","Frank C. van den",""],["Somerville","Rachel S.",""],["Kang","Xi",""]]}

To verify the optical performance of\nthe instrument, extensive tests were performed at CEA on the flight model (FM)\nof the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM) at cryogenic temperatures and in the\ninfrared. This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at\n5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the\nPSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a\nmicroscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an\nover-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a\npoint source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct\nPSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native\nresolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were\n5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was\nidentified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror. After correction,\ntwo additional test campaigns were carried out, and we show that the shape of\nthe PSF is conform to expectations. The FWHM of the PSFs are 0.18-0.20 arcsec,\nin agreement with simulations. 56.1-59.2% of the total encircled energy\n(normalized to a 5 arcsec radius) is contained within the first dark Airy ring,\nover the whole field of view. At longer wavelengths (7.7-25.5 microns), this\npercentage is 57-68%. MIRIM is thus compliant with the optical quality\nrequirements. This characterization of the MIRIM PSF, as well as the\ndeconvolution method presented here, are of particular importance, not only for\nthe verification of the optical quality and the MIRI calibration, but also for\nscientific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 22:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Guillard","P.",""],["Rodet","T.",""],["Ronayette","S.",""],["Amiaux","J.",""],["Abergel","A.",""],["Moreau","V.",""],["Augueres","J.

The SMC's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows us\nto separate members from foreground stars.

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the moss is\nunipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the\nmagnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line\ninclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field\nis mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux\nvariability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the\nmagnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because\nmost of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic\nflux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly\ndynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on\ntime-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from\nour extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some\nevidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G\n(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of\nlow-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of\nour simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find\nno clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes\nin the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most\nindividual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,\nrespectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy\nrequirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be\nsufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels\nmay be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Brooks","David H.",""],["Warren","Harry P.",""],["Winebarger","Amy R.",""]]}

As a result, at small-scales the\nbaryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional\nneutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai\nformulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations. Since T_e \\sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic\noscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely\nsuppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high\nwavenumber k.

Because the present study can trace the\n5'-scale spatial variation of the extinction, it has an advantage over the\nprevious studies, such as the one by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis, who used\nthe COBE/DIRBE data to derive the dust temperature distribution with a spatial\nresolution of 1^\\circ.

Supervisor: Graham Kirby","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SE","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to\ncomprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic\nbehaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide\nvariety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms\nand communication policies leads to ever more complex performance\ncharacteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour\nunder different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be\nconfigurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various\nstakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately\npredict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most\nappropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated\nexperiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can\nfind configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting\nbehavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's\nbehaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running\nsuch experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for\ndeciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is\ndiscussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have\nbeen used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for\nconfiguring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case\nstudy, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a\nproduct from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the\napplicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.\nTaguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-\nDirectory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to\nsystem administrators and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 08:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Sage","Aled",""]]}
