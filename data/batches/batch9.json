These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks\nalong faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under\nthe assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning\ncan occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in\nsolar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells\nwith variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere\ntransforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by\ncontraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably\nformed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations\nonly weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial\nstrike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to\ndespinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking\nnorth-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is\nthinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion\nconsists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion\non a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation\nof the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and\ndespinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults\ndiffering in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to\nthe orientation of lobate scarps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 09:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09","authors_parsed":[["Beuthe","Mikael",""]]}

The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on\nthe length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous\nat low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place\nfluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as\na whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)\nthe system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domain\nstate, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the\nAsakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these\ntwo different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density\ndistribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak\nshape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium\ndomain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded)\ntransition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial\ncorrelation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder\ndiameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the\ntransition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of the\ncylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore\ncritical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increase\nlogarithmically with the length of the pore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 12:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Winkler","Alexander",""],["Wilms","Dorothea",""],["Virnau","Peter",""],["Binder","Kurt",""]]}

Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the\nchoice of the stellar yields. We adopt a widely used model for the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellar\nnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical\nspecies. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis\nin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the model\npredictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak\nelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.\nThe main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models\nassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations\nare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova\nexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in\nmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of\nrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted\nrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the different\ntreatments of convection.

In spite of their importance, both these processes still have\nto be better understood and characterized.

The technique of\nZeeman-Doppler Imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of the\nstar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of Vega at two different\nepochs. We confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the mean\nline profiles. The amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines of\nhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for a\nsignal of magnetic origin. The short-term evolution of polarized signatures is\nconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \\pm 0.008 d. The reconstructed\nmagnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,\nclosely concentrated around the rotation pole. This polar feature is\naccompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. No\nsignificant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span of\none year. The repeated observation of a weak photospheric magnetic field on\nVega suggests that a previously unknown type of magnetic stars exists in the\nintermediate-mass domain. Vega may well be the first confirmed member of a much\nlarger, as yet unexplored, class of weakly-magnetic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 14:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 07:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Petit","P.",""],["Ligni\u00e8res","F.",""],["Wade","G.

The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15","authors_parsed":[["Khisti","Ashish",""],["Wornell","Gregory",""]]}

For Ag-104(m) (I-pi = 2(+)), the\nanisotropy of the beta particles provided the NMR/ON resonance signal at nu =\n627.7(4) MHz. Using the new value for the hyperfine field of Ag in Fe, this\nfrequency corresponds to the magnetic moment mu(Ag-104m) = +3.691(3) mu(N),\nwhich is significantly more precise than previous results. The magnetic moments\nof the even-A Ag102 -110 isotopes are discussed in view of the competition\nbetween the (pi g(9/2))(7/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) and the (pi\ng(9/2))(9/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) configurations. The magnetic\nmoments of the ground and isomeric states of Ag-104 can be explained by an\nalmost complete mixing of these two configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Golovko","V.
