Correlations between the emergence of new VLBI components\nfrom the core, flares in linearly polarized radio flux, and gamma-ray activity\nin bright EGRET-detected blazars supported a picture in which the gamma-ray and\nthe radio band emission arises in the same shocked region of the jet, with the\nhigh energy emission produced via inverse Compton scattering by the\nsynchrotron-emitting electrons in the jet. Quantitative tests of this scenario,\nhowever, were hampered by insufficient temporal sampling of the data and the\nsimple nature of the models adopted. The extensive data from Fermi coupled with\nthe wealth of well-sampled radio band data from old as well as new programs\nsuch as the F-GAMMA project now permit statistical studies for large numbers of\nsources, including weak HBLs, and detailed analyses of individual highly-active\nclass members.

The relay is\nassumed to operate over an orthogonal band with respect to the underlying IC,\nand the overall system is referred to as IC with an out-of-band relay (IC-OBR).\nThe system can be seen as operating over two parallel interference-limited\nchannels: The first is a standard Gaussian IC and the second is a Gaussian\nrelay channel characterized by two sources and destinations communicating\nthrough the relay without direct links. We refer to the second parallel channel\nas OBR Channel (OBRC). The main aim of this work is to identify conditions\nunder which optimal operation, in terms of the capacity region of the IC-OBR,\nentails either signal relaying and/or interference forwarding by the relay,\nwith either a separable or non-separable use of the two parallel channels, IC\nand OBRC. Here \"separable\" refers to transmission of independent information\nover the two constituent channels. For a basic model in which the OBRC consists\nof four orthogonal channels from sources to relay and from relay to\ndestinations (IC-OBR Type-I), a condition is identified under which signal\nrelaying and separable operation is optimal. When this condition is not\nsatisfied, various scenarios are identified in which interference forwarding\nand non-separable operation are necessary to achieve optimal performance. In\nthese scenarios, the system exploits the \"excess capacity\" on the OBRC via\ninterference forwarding to drive the IC-OBR system in specific interference\nregimes (strong or mixed). The analysis is then turned to a more complex\nIC-OBR, in which the OBRC consists of only two orthogonal channels, one from\nsources to relay and one from relay to destinations (IC-OBR Type-II). For this\nchannel, some capacity resuls are derived that parallel the conclusions for\nIC-OBR Type-I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2010 20:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Sahin","Onur",""],["Simeone","Osvaldo",""],["Erkip","Elza",""]]}

The limitation can be circumvented by\nexploiting the equivalence of the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force to\ncreate synthetic magnetic fields in rotating neutral systems. This was\ndemonstrated by the appearance of quantized vortices in pioneering experiments\non rotating quantum gases, a hallmark of superfluids or superconductors in a\nmagnetic field. However, because of technical issues limiting the maximum\nrotation velocity, the metastable nature of the rotating state and the\ndifficulty of applying stable rotating optical lattices, rotational approaches\nare not able to reach the large fields required for quantum Hall physics.

We advance a natural\nconjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator\n[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is\nessentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of\nthe standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a\nquestion that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature\n[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture\nimplies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This\nentails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by\nsmall quantum circuits, whose row-supports are \"nearly-disjoint.\" (2) We give a\nsimple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any\nefficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can\nbe distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum\nalgorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a\nproblem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired\noracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's \"GLN conjecture\" [A10] implies our\nconjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture\nwas recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open\nfor depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an\noracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open\nproblem.

For a given set of conditions, one specific\nconfiguration may be better than another with respect to measures such as\nresource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were\nset dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was\nhypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to\nconverge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a\npriori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by\nadopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to\nthe peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed\nstorage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload\nand churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented\nusing a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The\nexperimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and\nsuggest several future research topics. The findings of this thesis could be\nexploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on\nharnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to\nbe exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 10:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-05","authors_parsed":[["Tauber","Markus",""]]}

We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for\ndifferent elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions. We assume that\nthe intrinsic contribution is independent of B, so that any B dependence of the\nphase curves is due to interparticle shadowing, which must also act similarly\nfor all colors. We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models\nto fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening. Eliminating the\nmodeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the\nopposition effect: for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent\nbackscattering; for the C ring, an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may\nalso be present.\n  Based on our simulations, the width of the interparticle shadowing effect is\nroughly proportional to B. This follows from the observation that as B\ndecreases, the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor\nupper ring layers, whereas at larger $B$'s the dense inner parts are visible.\nThe elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of\nthe B ring tilt effect (the increase of brightness with elevation). From\ncomparison of the magnitude of the tilt effect at different filters, we show\nthat multiple scattering can account for at most a 10% brightness increase as B\n-> 26^o, whereas the remaining 20% brightening is due to a variable degree of\ninterparticle shadowing. The negative tilt effect of the middle A ring is well\nexplained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the\nobserved A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2010 12:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Salo","Heikki",""],["French","Richard G.",""]]}

We find that\nfour out of the 12 sources with adequate photon statistics and hence reliable\nX-ray spectra, show evidence for a hard X-ray spectral index (~1) or\nharder,consistent with a Compton-thick spectrum. In total 12 out of the 26 DOGs\nshow evidence for flat spectral indices. However, owing to the limited photon\nstatistics we cannot differentiate whether these are flat because they are\nreflection-dominated or because they show moderate amounts of absorption. Seven\nDOGs show relatively steep spectra (>1.4) indicative of small column densities.\nAll the above suggest a fraction of Compton-thick sources that does not exceed\n5%. The average X-ray spectrum of all 26 DOGs is hard (~1.1) or even harder\n(~0.6) when we exclude the brightest sources. These spectral indices are well\nin agreement with the stacked spectrum of X-ray undetected sources (~0.8 in the\nCDFN).

In this context, the Italian research Foundation TERA is\ndeveloping fast-cycling accelerators, dubbed 'cyclinacs'.

It\nconsists of an Electron Beam Ion Source, a superconducting isochronous\ncyclotron and a high-gradient linac. All these machines are pulsed at high\nrepetition rate (100-400 Hz). The source should deliver both C6+ and H2+ ions\nin short pulses (1.5 {\\mu}s flat-top) and with sufficient intensity (at least\n108 fully stripped carbon ions at 300 Hz). The cyclotron accelerates the ions\nto 120 MeV/u. It features a compact design (with superconducting coils) and a\nlow power consumption. The linac has a novel C-band high gradient structure and\naccelerates the ions to variable energies up to 400 MeV/u. High RF frequencies\nlead to power consumptions which are much lower than the ones of synchrotrons\nfor the same ion extraction energy.
