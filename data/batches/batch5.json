These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks\nalong faults. The type and orientation of faults are usually determined under\nthe assumption of a constant lithospheric thickness, but lithospheric thinning\ncan occur at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in\nsolar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells\nwith variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere\ntransforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by\ncontraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably\nformed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations\nonly weakly affect the despinning faulting pattern consisting of equatorial\nstrike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to\ndespinning, the despinning pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking\nnorth-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is\nthinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion\nconsists of faults striking north/south. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion\non a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation\nof the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and\ndespinning makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults\ndiffering in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to\nthe orientation of lobate scarps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 09:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-09","authors_parsed":[["Beuthe","Mikael",""]]}

The nature of the phase coexistence at the transition depends on\nthe length of the pore: For very long pores the system is axially homogeneous\nat low temperatures. At the chemical potential where the transition takes place\nfluctuations occur between vapor-like and liquid-like states of the cylinder as\na whole. At somewhat higher temperatures (but still far below bulk criticality)\nthe system at phase coexistence is in an axially inhomogeneous multi-domain\nstate, where long cylindrical liquid-like and vapor-like domains alternate.\nUsing Monte Carlo simulations for the Ising/lattice gas model and the\nAsakura-Oosawa model of colloid-polymer mixtures the transition between these\ntwo different scenarios is characterized. It is shown that the density\ndistribution changes gradually from a double-peak structure to a triple-peak\nshape, and the correlation length in axial direction (measuring the equilibrium\ndomain length) becomes much smaller than the cylinder length. The (rounded)\ntransition to the disordered phase of the fluid occurs when the axial\ncorrelation length has decreased to a value comparable to the cylinder\ndiameter. It is also suggested that adsorption hysteresis vanishes when the\ntransition from the simple domain state to the multi-domain state of the\ncylindrical pore occurs. We predict that the difference between the pore\ncritical temperature and the hysteresis critical emperature should increase\nlogarithmically with the length of the pore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 12:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Winkler","Alexander",""],["Wilms","Dorothea",""],["Virnau","Peter",""],["Binder","Kurt",""]]}

Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the\nchoice of the stellar yields. We adopt a widely used model for the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy and test the effects of changing the stellar\nnucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical\nspecies. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis\nin stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect the model\npredictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak\nelements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen.\nThe main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models\nassuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations\nare: (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova\nexplosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in\nmodels of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of\nrotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted\nrates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions, and (vi) the different\ntreatments of convection.

In spite of their importance, both these processes still have\nto be better understood and characterized.

The technique of\nZeeman-Doppler Imaging is then used to determine the rotation period of the\nstar and reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of Vega at two different\nepochs. We confirm the detection of circularly polarized signatures in the mean\nline profiles. The amplitude of the signatures is larger when spectral lines of\nhigher magnetic sensitivity are selected for the analysis, as expected for a\nsignal of magnetic origin. The short-term evolution of polarized signatures is\nconsistent with a rotational period of 0.732 \\pm 0.008 d. The reconstructed\nmagnetic topology unveils a magnetic region of radial field orientation,\nclosely concentrated around the rotation pole. This polar feature is\naccompanied by a small number of magnetic patches at lower latitudes. No\nsignificant variability in the field structure is observed over a time span of\none year. The repeated observation of a weak photospheric magnetic field on\nVega suggests that a previously unknown type of magnetic stars exists in the\nintermediate-mass domain. Vega may well be the first confirmed member of a much\nlarger, as yet unexplored, class of weakly-magnetic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 14:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 07:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Petit","P.",""],["Ligni\u00e8res","F.",""],["Wade","G.

The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15","authors_parsed":[["Khisti","Ashish",""],["Wornell","Gregory",""]]}

For Ag-104(m) (I-pi = 2(+)), the\nanisotropy of the beta particles provided the NMR/ON resonance signal at nu =\n627.7(4) MHz. Using the new value for the hyperfine field of Ag in Fe, this\nfrequency corresponds to the magnetic moment mu(Ag-104m) = +3.691(3) mu(N),\nwhich is significantly more precise than previous results. The magnetic moments\nof the even-A Ag102 -110 isotopes are discussed in view of the competition\nbetween the (pi g(9/2))(7/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) and the (pi\ng(9/2))(9/2+)(-3)(nu d(5/2)nu g(7/2))(5/2+) configurations. The magnetic\nmoments of the ground and isomeric states of Ag-104 can be explained by an\nalmost complete mixing of these two configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Golovko","V.

In particular, in the current theoretical paradigm of\ngalaxy formation, AGN feedback is believed to play a crucial role in regulating\nthe levels of activity in galaxies, in relatively massive halos at low\nredshift. Only in recent years, however, has detailed statistical information\non the dependence of galaxy activity on stellar mass, parent halo mass and\nhierarchy has become available. In this paper, we compare the fractions of\ngalaxies belonging to different activity classes (star-forming, AGN and radio\nactive) with predictions from four different and independently developed\nsemi-analytical models. We adopt empirical relations to convert physical\nproperties into observables (H_alpha emission lines, OIII line strength and\nradio power). We demonstrate that all models used in this study reproduce the\noverall distributions of galaxies belonging to different activity classes as a\nfunction of stellar mass and halo mass: star forming galaxies and the strongest\nradio sources are preferentially associated with low-mass and high-mass\ngalaxies/halos respectively. However, model predictions differ from\nobservational measurements in a number of ways. All models used in our study\npredict that almost every >1.e12 Msun dark matter halo and/or >1.e11 Msun\ngalaxy should host a bright radio source, while only a small fraction of\ngalaxies belong to this class in the data. In addition, radio brightness is\nexpected to depend strongly on the mass of the parent halo mass in the models,\nwhile strong and weak radio galaxies are found in similar environments in data.\nOur results highlight that the distribution of AGN as a function of stellar\nmass provides one of the most promising discriminants between different gas\naccretion schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 20:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Dec 2010 13:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Fontanot","Fabio",""],["Pasquali","Anna",""],["De Lucia","Gabriella",""],["Bosch","Frank C. van den",""],["Somerville","Rachel S.",""],["Kang","Xi",""]]}

To verify the optical performance of\nthe instrument, extensive tests were performed at CEA on the flight model (FM)\nof the Mid-InfraRed IMager (MIRIM) at cryogenic temperatures and in the\ninfrared. This paper reports on the point spread function (PSF) measurements at\n5.6 microns, the shortest operating wavelength for imaging. At 5.6 microns the\nPSF is not Nyquist-sampled, so we use am original technique that combines a\nmicroscanning measurement strategy with a deconvolution algorithm to obtain an\nover-resolved MIRIM PSF. The microscanning consists in a sub-pixel scan of a\npoint source on the focal plane. A data inversion method is used to reconstruct\nPSF images that are over-resolved by a factor of 7 compared to the native\nresolution of MIRI. We show that the FWHM of the high-resolution PSFs were\n5-10% wider than that obtained with Zemax simulations. The main cause was\nidentified as an out-of-specification tilt of the M4 mirror. After correction,\ntwo additional test campaigns were carried out, and we show that the shape of\nthe PSF is conform to expectations. The FWHM of the PSFs are 0.18-0.20 arcsec,\nin agreement with simulations. 56.1-59.2% of the total encircled energy\n(normalized to a 5 arcsec radius) is contained within the first dark Airy ring,\nover the whole field of view. At longer wavelengths (7.7-25.5 microns), this\npercentage is 57-68%. MIRIM is thus compliant with the optical quality\nrequirements. This characterization of the MIRIM PSF, as well as the\ndeconvolution method presented here, are of particular importance, not only for\nthe verification of the optical quality and the MIRI calibration, but also for\nscientific applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 22:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Guillard","P.",""],["Rodet","T.",""],["Ronayette","S.",""],["Amiaux","J.",""],["Abergel","A.",""],["Moreau","V.",""],["Augueres","J.

We previously conducted a\ncensus of yellow supergiants within M31 and found that the evolutionary tracks\npredict a yellow supergiant duration an order of magnitude longer than we\nobserved. Here we turn our attention to the SMC, where the metallicity is 10x\nlower than that of M31, which is important as metallicity strongly affects\nmassive star evolution. The SMC's large radial velocity (~160 km/s) allows us\nto separate members from foreground stars. Observations of ~500 candidates\nyielded 176 near-certain SMC supergiants, 16 possible SMC supergiants, along\nwith 306 foreground stars and provide good relative numbers of yellow\nsupergiants down to 12Mo.

This paper explores and\nvalidates the existing literature empirically to find out the critical success\nfactors that lead to the success of ERP in context to Indian retail industry.\nThe findings of the results provide valuable insights for the researchers and\npractitioners who are interested in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning\nsystems in retail industry, how best they can utilize their limited resources\nand to pay adequate attention to those factors that are most likely to have an\nimpact upon the implementation of the ERP system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 00:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Garg","Poonam",""]]}

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the moss is\nunipolar, the spatial distribution of magnetic flux evolves slowly, and the\nmagnetic field is only moderately inclined. We show that the field line\ninclination and horizontal component are coherent, and that the magnetic field\nis mostly sheared in the inter-moss regions where the highest magnetic flux\nvariability is seen. Using extrapolations from SP magnetograms we show that the\nmagnetic connectivity in the moss is different than in the quiet Sun because\nmost of the magnetic field extends to significant coronal heights. The magnetic\nflux, field vector, and chromospheric emission in the moss also appear highly\ndynamic, but actually show only small scale variations in magnitude on\ntime-scales longer than the cooling times for hydrodynamic loops computed from\nour extrapolations, suggesting high-frequency (continuous) heating events. Some\nevidence is found for flux (Ca 2 intensity) changes on the order of 100--200 G\n(DN) on time-scales of 20--30 mins that could be taken as indicative of\nlow-frequency heating. We find, however, that only a small fraction (10%) of\nour simulated loops would be expected to cool on these time-scales, and we find\nno clear evidence that the flux changes consistently produce intensity changes\nin the chromosphere. The magnetic flux and chromospheric intensity in most\nindividual SOT pixels in the moss vary by less than ~ 20% and ~ 10%,\nrespectively, on loop cooling time-scales. In view of the high energy\nrequirements of the chromosphere, we suggest that these variations could be\nsufficient for the heating of `warm' EUV loops, but that the high basal levels\nmay be more important for powering the hot core loops rooted in the moss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Brooks","David H.",""],["Warren","Harry P.",""],["Winebarger","Amy R.",""]]}

Specifically, it is the combined\npressure from the baryon thermal motions and the residual long-range\nelectrostatic potentials resulted from the imperfect Debye shielding, that\nfights against the gravitational collapse. As a result, at small-scales the\nbaryons would oscillate at the ion-acoustic, instead of the conventional\nneutral acoustic, frequency. In this paper we extend and improve the Chen-Lai\nformulation with the attention to the Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations. Since T_e \\sim T_i in the post-reionization era, the ion acoustic\noscillations would inevitably suffer the Landau damping which severely\nsuppresses the baryon density spectrum in the regimes of intermediate and high\nwavenumber k. To describe this Landau-damping phenomenon more appropriately, we\nfind it necessary to modify the filtering wavenumber k_f in our analysis. It\nwould be interesting if our predicted Landau damping of the ion-acoustic\noscillations can be observed at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 06:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Chang","Feng-Yin",""],["Chen","Pisin",""]]}

Zetametry measurements show that globular complexes have a\ntotal positive charge when the charge ratio of species introduced in the\nmixture [-]/[+]intro > 1 and a total 20 negative charge when [-]/[+]intro < 1.\nThis comes from the presence of charged species in slight excess in a layer at\nthe surface of the globules. The globule finite size is determined by the Debye\nlength k-1 whatever the way the physicochemical parameters are modified in the\nsystem, as long as chain-protein interactions are of simple electrostatics\nnature. The mean number of proteins per primary complex Nlyso_comp grows\nexponentially on a master curve with k-1. This enables to picture 25 the\nmechanisms of formation of the complexes. There is an initial stage of\nformation where the growth of the complexes is only driven by attractions\nbetween opposite species associated with counterion release. During the growth\nof the complexes, the globules progressively repell themselves by electrostatic\nrepulsion because their charge increases. When this repulsion becomes dominent\nin the system, globules stop growing and behave like charged colloids: they\naggregate 30 with a RLCA process, which leads to the formation of fractal\naggregates of dimension Df 2.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 07:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-26","authors_parsed":[["Gummel","J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","","LLB"],["Bou\u00e9","Fran\u00e7ois","","LLB"],["Clemens","Daniel","","LLB"],["Cousin","Fabrice","","LLB"]]}

Supervisor: Graham Kirby","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.SE","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  The ever-increasing complexity of software systems makes them hard to\ncomprehend, predict and tune due to emergent properties and non-deterministic\nbehaviour. Complexity arises from the size of software systems and the wide\nvariety of possible operating environments: the increasing choice of platforms\nand communication policies leads to ever more complex performance\ncharacteristics. In addition, software systems exhibit different behaviour\nunder different workloads. Many software systems are designed to be\nconfigurable so that policies can be chosen to meet the needs of various\nstakeholders. For complex software systems it can be difficult to accurately\npredict the effects of a change and to know which configuration is most\nappropriate. This thesis demonstrates that it is useful to run automated\nexperiments that measure a selection of system configurations. Experiments can\nfind configurations that meet the stakeholders' needs, find interesting\nbehavioural characteristics, and help produce predictive models of the system's\nbehaviour. The design and use of ACT (Automated Configuration Tool) for running\nsuch experiments is described, in combination a number of search strategies for\ndeciding on the configurations to measure. Design Of Experiments (DOE) is\ndiscussed, with emphasis on Taguchi Methods. These statistical methods have\nbeen used extensively in manufacturing, but have not previously been used for\nconfiguring software systems. The novel contribution here is an industrial case\nstudy, applying the combination of ACT and Taguchi Methods to DC-Directory, a\nproduct from Data Connection Ltd (DCL). The case study investigated the\napplicability of Taguchi Methods for configuring complex software systems.\nTaguchi Methods were found to be useful for modelling and configuring DC-\nDirectory, making them a valuable addition to the techniques available to\nsystem administrators and developers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 08:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-01","authors_parsed":[["Sage","Aled",""]]}
