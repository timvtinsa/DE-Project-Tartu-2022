In searching for methods of non-decryptable\nencryption as well as ways to provide unique sequences, other than using prime\nnumbers, the idea of using repeating decimals came to me.

In this paper it is shown\nthat the addition of transitions where a point is moved from one location to\nthe other can aid in shortening the mixing time of the chain. Here the mixing\ntime of the chain is analyzed through coupling, and use of the swap moves\nallows for analysis of a broader class of chains. Furthermore, these swap moves\ncan be employed in perfect sampling algorithms via the dominated coupling from\nthe past procedure of Kendall and M{\\o}ller. This method can be applied to any\npairwise interaction model with repulsion. In particular, an application to the\nStrauss process is developed in detail, and the swap chains are shown to be\nmuch faster than standard birth-death chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 17:37:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 05:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31","authors_parsed":[["Huber","Mark",""]]}

The power\nspectra of the temperature anisotropies and the $E$-mode polarization of the\nCMB are explained well by the inflationary paradigm. The next generation of CMB\nexperiments aim at providing the most direct evidence for inflation through the\ndetection of $B$-modes in the CMB polarization, presumed to have been caused by\ngravitational waves generated during the inflationary epoch around $10^{-34}$s.\nThe $B$-mode polarization signals are very small ($\\leq$10$^{-8}$K) compared\nwith the temperature anisotropies ($\\sim 10^{-4}$K). Systematic effects in CMB\ntelescopes can cause leakage from temperature anisotropy into polarization.\nBolometric interferometry (BI) is a novel approach to measuring this small\nsignal with lower leakage. If BI can be made to work over wide bandwidth\n($\\sim20-30\\%$) it can provide similar sensitivity to imagers.

The density of defects after the sweep\ncan be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement. We argue that the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of an ion chain in a Paul trap constitutes an ideal\nscenario to test the inhomogeneous extension of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism,\nwhich lacks experimental evidence to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 17:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2010 10:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02","authors_parsed":[["De Chiara","Gabriele",""],["del Campo","Adolfo",""],["Morigi","Giovanna",""],["Plenio","Martin B.",""],["Retzker","Alex",""]]}

The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility\nof significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.\nFive such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical\nafterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are\nsystematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst\ndensities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),\nor to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray\nfluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale\nenvironments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying\nhosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near\neach burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence\n(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10\",\nwhile somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with\nfaint galaxies at separations of ~2\". By measuring redshifts for the brighter\ngalaxies in three cases (z=0.111, 0.473, 0.403) we find physical offsets of\n~30-75 kpc, while for the faint hosts the assumption of z>1 leads to offsets of\n~15 kpc. Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be\nexplained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two\npossibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the\ncenters of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due\nto the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and\nhave fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Berger","E.","","Harvard"]]}

A remarkably rich phase diagram emerges on tuning\nthe correlation strength U. The Ir magnetic moment are always found to be\nnon-collinearly ordered. However, the ground state changes from a magnetic\nmetal at weak U, to a Mott insulator at large U. Most interestingly, the\nintermediate U regime is found to be a Dirac semi-metal, with vanishing density\nof states at the Fermi energy. It also exhibits topological properties -\nmanifested by special surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, that connect\nthe bulk Dirac points. This Dirac phase, a three dimensional analog of\ngraphene, is proposed as the ground state of Y$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and related\ncompounds. A narrow window of magnetic `axion' insulator, with axion parameter\n$\\theta=\\pi$, may also be present at intermediate U.

Perturbations are swept\nalong the field, to be ultimately dissipated as they are sheared ever more\nstrongly.

We study notions of Einstein\nmetrics, constant scalar curvature metrics, and the Yamabe problem on the\ndouble tetrahedron, with some reference to the possibilities on a general\npiecewise flat manifold. The main tool is analysis of Regge's Einstein-Hilbert\nfunctional, a piecewise flat analogue of the Einstein-Hilbert (or total scalar\ncurvature) functional on Riemannian manifolds. We study the\nEinstein-Hilbert-Regge functional on the space of metrics and on discrete\nconformal classes of metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 23:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Champion","Daniel",""],["Glickenstein","David",""],["Young","Andrea",""]]}

We show that such description is\nsuitable for ideal matter waves in quadratic time-dependent confinement as well\nas for harmonically trapped Bose Einstein condensates in the Thomas-Fermi\nregime. In arbitrary interacting regimes, the TWE combined with the moment\nmethod yields the low-energy spectrum of a condensate as predicted by\nindependent variational methods. TWE also gives the right breathing mode\nfrequency for long-ranged interactions decaying as $1/r^2$ in 3D and for a\ncontact potential in 2D. Quantum signatures, beyond the TWE, may only be found\nin the condensate dynamics beyond the regimes of classical phase-space\npropagation identified here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2010 23:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19","authors_parsed":[["Impens","Fran\u00e7ois",""],["Gu\u00e9ry-Odelin","David",""]]}
