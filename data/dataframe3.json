We argue here that this assumption agrees with the absence of the GZK\ncutoff (at least according to AGASA data) in the energy spectrum of the cosmic\nray due to the cosmic interaction with the CMB at $6\\times 10^{19} eV$ or\nabove. Within 50 Mpc from Earth, the matter and light distributions are close\nto an anisotropic distribution, where the local cluster and local\nsuper-clusters of galaxies can be identified. In contrast, the ultra high\nenergy comic rays data is consistent to an almost isotropic distribution, and\nthere is no correlation between their arrival direction and astronomical\nsources within our local cluster. This means that the events above the GZK\ncutoff come from distances above 50 Mpc, without an apparent energy loss. This\nscenario is plausible under the assumption of the CMB concentrated only within\n3-4 Mpc from Earth. In other words, the CMB has a local origin linked only to\nthe local super-cluster of galaxies. In addition, the galactic and\nextragalactic energy spectra index within the energy equipartition theorem\nstrongly constrains the dark matter and dark energy hypothesis, essential in\nthe Big Bang cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 22:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16","authors_parsed":[["Navia","C.

Offering a\nhigh contrast in intensity with respect to the background (either bright in\nemission if observed at the limb, or dark in absorption if observed on disk)\nthese cool blobs are often observed falling down from high coronal heights\nabove active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon\nhas been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint\nconcentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally\nform in the corona. This effect has been termed 'catastrophic cooling' and is\nthe predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work we further\ninvestigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting\nin the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb\nin the Ca II H line performed by the SOT instrument on board of the Hinode\nsatellite. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD\nsimulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated\ntowards the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic\nreconnection events), and by Alfven waves generated at the photosphere. It is\nfound that if a loop is heated predominantly from Alfven waves coronal rain is\ninhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence coronal\nrain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal\nloops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain\nas a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2009 12:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20","authors_parsed":[["Antolin","P.",""],["Shibata","K.",""]]}

In this context, the entropy refers to the average\ninformation content in a unit of data. It is found that the handshapes, as\nfundamental units of ASL, are less redundant than phonemes, the equivalent\nfundamental units of spoken English, and that their entropy is much closer to\nthe maximum possible information content. This explains why the slower signs\ncan produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy\ncompensates for the slow rate of sign production.

Since the gravitational redshift\nmethod is independent of surface gravity from atmosphere models, we investigate\nthe mean mass of DAs with spectroscopic Teff both above and below 12000 K; fits\nto line profiles give a rapid increase in the mean mass with decreasing Teff.\nOur results are consistent with no significant change in mean mass: <M>^hot =\n0.640 +/- 0.014 Msun and <M>^cool = 0.686 +0.035 -0.039 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2010 01:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17","authors_parsed":[["Falcon","Ross E.",""],["Winget","D.

The marginal likelihood approach of Chib (1995) is used to choose the\nnumber of factors, with the posterior density ordinates approximated by\nGaussian copula. Simulation and real data applications suggest that the\nproposed simulation method is computationally much more efficient than the\napproach of Chib. Nardari and Shephard (2006}. This increase in computational\nefficiency is particularly important in calculating marginal likelihoods\nbecause it is necessary to carry out the simulation a number of times to\nestimate the posterior ordinates for a given marginal likelihood. In addition\nto the MCMC method, the paper also proposes a fast approximate EM method to\nestimate the factor multivariate stochastic volatility model.
